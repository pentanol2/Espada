HomeBeliefsCommunityFoundersContactMoreThis website is owned by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United Kingdom.
The National Spiritual Assembly is the elected governing body of the Bahá'ís of the UK and is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee.
Registered in England – Company limited by guarantee No. 355737, Registered Charity (1967) 250851
Registered with the Scottish Charity Regulator (SC041673)
The Assembly also represents the Bahá'í communities of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
Registered address: 27 Rutland Gate, London SW7 1PD, UK.At a time of rapid change in the world today, humanity needs, more than ever, a unified vision of the nature and purpose of our lives and of the future of our society. Such a vision unfolds within the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet Founder of the Bahá’í Faith.  

The Bahá’í community of the United Kingdom is exploring Bahá'u'lláh’s spiritual teachings with people of all backgrounds and is learning how this vision of the oneness of mankind, best expressed by the principle of unity in diversity, can be translated into action for the betterment of the world.Throughout history, God has sent to humanity, according to the needs of the time, a series of Divine Educators, known as Manifestations of God. These Divine Educators include Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Their distinct social and spiritual teachings have guided humanity’s efforts to advance civilisation.Bahá’u’lláh, the most recent of these Divine Educators, teaches that humanity is on a path to maturity, much like an individual who progresses through various stages of development. The current turmoil in the world can be viewed as humanity experiencing the turbulence of adolescence. 

The writings of Bahá'u'lláh provide a wealth of spiritual teachings that assist us in progressing on this path towards maturity, and in building a peaceful and unified world.The Bahá’í teachings explain that God, the Creator of the universe, is beyond the comprehension of the human mind. However, His attributes are reflected in the world around us, and His teachings and guidance are given to humanity through the Divine Educators, or Manifestations of God, who usher in new religious eras and unfold new horizons of human potential.The Bahá’í Faith was founded in 19th century Iran by Bahá’u’lláh, whose title means the Glory of God. Bahá’ís believe that Bahá’u’lláh is the latest in a series of divinely inspired educators, including, Krishna, Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, entrusted by God to guide the spiritual, moral and social life of humanity..Find out more...Tel: 020 7584 2566?Address:27 Rutland Gate, London, SW7 1PDFor all media related enquiries, please contact the Office of Public Affairs.?Email: opa@bahai.org.ukWebsite:The Bahá’í community of the UK consists of approximately 7000 individuals coming from all backgrounds, and living across all regions of the UK. The Bahá’í community, along with likeminded friends, neighbours and colleagues, is dedicated to working with all peoples to contribute to the spiritual and material progress of society.Find out more...Prayer is central to the life of Bahá’ís. Baha’is pray daily, as well as gather regularly to worship and reflect with their friends and neighbours in a diverse array of neighbourhoods and villages across the country. These gatherings engender a collective spirit of solidarity and service to the community.Find out more...Bahá’u’lláh's vision of a united, just, equitable and prosperous world, requires more than high ideals and lofty words. As such, Bahá’u’lláhs teachings call upon Bahá’ís to work together with their neighbours, friends and colleagues, to identify and carry out acts of service to better their communities and society.Find out more...Only through education, Bahá'ís believe, can each individual achieve their potential. This education, however, must be both intellectual and spiritual. It is to this end that the Bahá'í community has been developing educational programmes aimed at unlocking the capacities of children, youth and adults, from all backgrounds, to contribute to social progress.Find out more...There are no clergy in the Bahá’í faith. The affairs of the Bahá’í community are administered by an elected Local Spiritual Assembly and a National Spiritual Assembly, with elections taking place once a year. The worldwide Bahá’í community receives guidance from the Universal House of Justice, which is elected every five years and resides in the Bahá’í World Centre in Haifa, Israel.Find out more...Bahá’ís commemorate 11 Holy Days throughout the year. Whilst there are no cultural traditions as to how these days are celebrated, Bahá’ís do suspend work on nine of these days. This year is particularly significant in that it marks 200 years since the birth of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith.Find out more...The past year has been marked by the bicentenary of the Birth of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith, which Baha’is around the world, together with their families, friends and neighbours are celebrating.Find out more..." 809.0 0.0 "UK Baha'i Community"

The Epsom & Ewell Liberal Democrats are local residents who work to promote a fair, free and open society. We raise our funds without any subsidy from governments, unions or businesses. For further information, please contact FOCUS@epsom-ewell-libdems.org.uk.We believe that governments and councils should provide the services people need, without imposing unnecessary limits or needlessly restricting individual freedoms. If you agree with this, help us to change Britain's future for good by joining the Liberal Democrats HERE.As so often happens, when a leader steps down the fictions they have spun and the milestones of their achievements unravel quickly, as their author cannot maintain the carapace that prevents proper scrutiny and they are seen for what they are.This is not an attack on the former leader of the County Council, more a reflection on leadership and what it requires for success as it might apply to many leadership roles, but especially in local politics.The following letter was sent just before Christmas by the Honourary Secretary of Epsom & Ewell Liberal Democrats.Dear Tim Martin,I have a feeling that you are not going to print this! Nevertheless, I must get what I have to say off my chest.Your magazine has been delivered to our house. It was not requested. However, I would have been happy to have received it, had it not been a pro-Brexit propaganda sheet.Jeremy John Durham Ashdown, Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, Paddy Ashdown has died.Royal Marine, Intelligence Officer in the Bosnian war zone, UN administrator helping Bosnia rebuild, Lib Dem leader admired by rivals and members alike, wise elder statesman, author, inspirational leader.Local party member Lakhi, who knew him personally, said:Responding to the publication of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services report into Surrey Fire and Rescue, Cllr Chris Botten, Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group at Surrey County Council said:""Yet again we read of a Surrey Service which has been judged Requires Improvement or Inadequate. Perhaps the report's most troubling criticism is that the service doesn't have a robust operational model and needs to ensure it has enough resources, (people and equipment) available to respond to risk in line with its risk management plan.Liberal Democrat County Councillors in Surrey have today voted against proposals put forward by the Independent Remuneration Panel (IRP). The report published by the IRP recommended that a Special Responsibility Allowance (SRA) of £10,000 be allocated to Deputy Cabinet Members, a set of roles only introduced to Surrey County Council in May this year.The enforced closure of the walking route to St Joseph's school from the Abelea Green estate, via the church car park, has led to increased congestion in White Horse Drive and chronic traffic problems in West Street and Rosebank.To reduce these problems, the school's governors have proposed a ""park and stride"" scheme. A petition will be considered on Monday by SCC's local committee for Epsom & Ewell, asking for the parking restrictions in the Abelea Green estate to be relaxed to facilitate this.""Things fall apart- the centre cannot hold

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world………..""These words of WB Yeats resonate.The bizarre nature of our current politics degenerates still further and nothing seems to be co-ordinated or connected. Like some high risk Mad Hatter's Tea Party each silo sits in a puddle of its own illogical absurdity.The directors of the Abelea Green management company have forced St Joseph's RC church in Epsom to bar the gate between their car park and St Joseph's primary school, to prevent St Margaret Drive on the Abelea Green estate being used to access the school via the car-park.After spending years trying, the directors who live on the estate eventually succeeded by pointing out that the lease for the car park access road mentions the church and the hall, but not the school.There will be peace:when attitudes change;when self-interest is seen as part of common interest;when old wrongs, old scores, old mistakesare deleted from the account;when the aim becomes cooperation and mutual benefitrather than revenge or seizing maximum personal or group gain;when justice and equality before the lawIt is quite ironic that Epsom's Residents' Association (RA) council is pushing to over-develop the site of the Wells social centre with a four-storey building of 23 flats.

If you are visiting France and friends invite you over for dinner, there are a few etiquette details that you will need to consider. Dining with the locals is a special occasion whether you do it in Paris, Marseille or the Cote d’Azur. Here are the main aspects of such celebrations that will not make you look ill-mannered in front of your hosts and escorts!French people are very punctual, and they take timing into significant consideration. They rarely accept excuses for being late. So, you have to make everything humanly possible to arrive on time for dinner, even if it means ending up a date with an escort Paris early. If you want to make friends and earn their respect, punctuality should not be one of your defects.People in France are in love with good wine; everybody knows that. Before arriving at the dinner party, your best choice is to stop by at a cellar or a winemaker and pick up a nice bottle of wine. You can even consult with the host first and inquire about the dishes they will serve, to determine the wine that best suits the meals. If you are not a connoisseur on this matter, ask one of your escorts to suggest an excellent wine for the upcoming dinner.If the host of a dinner party already has a stock full of wine, you can propose to bring some dessert. French people love a good, classy, sweet any time, so you can ultimately win their hearts with the right after dinner treat. Again, an escort Paris can provide you with valuable hints on what to bring and delight your hosts. And, if that option fails, remember that you can never go wrong with chocolate mousse.The best way to attend a French dinner party is with a pair. If you are new in town, and you do not have any lady friends that you can present to your hosts, you should ask some escorts to accompany you. These hot, sexy models love to take part in fancy dinner parties, and they will surely join you for the night.If you come with a pair and a beautiful one on top of that, your hosts will appreciate your visit even more and place you at the top of the list for future parties.French people do not shy away from any subject of conversation. Before accepting an invitation to their dinner party, make sure that you do not have any taboo topics that you would prefer to avoid. Talk about this issue with your escort Paris, so that she can break the news to them before you feel offended.It is custom French etiquette to leave a French dinner party right after dessert. Parisians hate it when the evening drags with no purpose. So, if you had your fill, take your escorts and head for the nearest exit. Your hosts will appreciate your consideration, and they will gladly invite you again.Comments are closed." 4620.0 0.0 Magicdeaf

Need more space, need less space, need a change, or financial reasons. Whatever your reason, if you need to sell your home, if you can get help in any way…..take it. Some people buy property to let, giving other people who cannot afford to buy a property the opportunity to rent the type of home they need.Here is an article/guide, which explains a little about property buying for letting.
http://www.itv.com/thismorning/home-garden/thinking-of-buying-a-property-to-let-louisa-fletcherWith four million households renting privately, the buy-to-let sector is booming and demand for rental property is at an all-time high.
For some, buy-to-let is an opportunity to create a nest egg or pension, for others, letting out their property is the best option when life throws a curveball – either due to relocation, a change in your relationship or financial circumstance.Buy-to-let involves committing a lot of money and typically taking out a mortgage. If house price rise, it’s possible to make big leveraged gains above your mortgage debt, but when they fall, your deposit gets hit and the mortgage stays the same. Think carefully, as your money might be able to perform better elsewhere, say a high-rate savings account. When choosing a property, think about your target tenant. I always advise buying a house rather than a flat. This widens your options for tenants to almost anyone – a singleton, students or a family. A small one or two bed flat will probably only appeal to a couple. Think about transport links and schools. Look where property prices are high – the higher the sales prices, the bigger the demand for property and this will echo in demand for rentals. I would advise looking in London and the Home Counties, but if you can’t afford that, it’s worth looking at university cities and towns in the North, where there’s a steady flow of students looking for accommodation.Work out how much rent you can expect to receive from the property each month versus how much the mortgage is per month. Look at the other costs involved, e.g. agents fees, maintenance fees, landlords insurance etc. Bottom line, if you can cover the mortgage and all other costs each month, you’ve still got someone in the property paying the mortgage for you . Any income you realise over and above that each month is a bonus.It is important to get the right price for your home. Overpricing your home can result in it not selling at all. If you underprice your home, it could sell quickly but then you are out of pocket. If you need to sell your house quickly for whatever reason, www.soldquickly.co.uk have the ability to help you do so.Here is a guide which may be helpful when thinking about selling your home, or even buying one. http://www.nationwide.co.uk/guides/planning-for-life-events/moving-home/planning-your-moveIf you’re buying or selling your home, you need to decide what order you want to do things in. There are three main options:
1. Buying and selling at the same time: this is the ideal situation, and if you can achieve it, you won’t have to take out a bridging loan to cover the cost of buying a new property before you’ve sold your old one. You also won’t have to keep all your possessions in storage. However, buying and selling simultaneously isn’t always easy to do.
2. Selling first: this puts you in a stronger position because you’ll be chain-free; you won’t have a property you have to sell when you look to buy a property. This means you can move faster when you find somewhere you want. However, there are disadvantages. You’ll need to first move into a rented place (or stay with friends or relatives while you look for a place to buy), then move again when you buy your new home.
Another potential issue is that prices may go up while you’re still looking leaving you less choice. You could make an agreement with the buyer to take your home off the market until you find somewhere appropriate to buy, but this would involve careful negotiation.
3. Buying first: if you do this, you’ll probably need a bridging loan to cover the price of your new home, plus you’ll have the expenses of having two homes at once. You also may be more vulnerable to buyers trying to drive down the price.Selling your house is not just a case of putting it on the market and waiting until someone buys it. To be able to sell your house fast scotland you must make it desirable and appealing. You want people to come into your home and feel like they would love to live there. Make sure its clean, tidy and any general repairs have been done. But also add little touches, such as flowers, candles, and maybe an ornament or two.

Welcome to the website for the North Bedfordshire Liberal Democrats for information from the party and the latest news from the Council.You can find out how to contact your local Lib Dem Councillor, and you can also follow us on twitter @BedfordLibDems and on Facebook @BedfordLD.For news from the directly elected, Lib Dem Mayor of Bedford Borough, Dave Hodgson - please click here.Mayor Dave Hodsgon has wished a very Happy New Year to all.Writing in his latest email update, Mayor Dave offers his best wishes to all for 2019, and also looked ahead at some of the major projects for which 2019 will be a very important year.You can sign up to receive regular email updates here, and in the meantime here's what Mayor Dave had to say in his email today:Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran's campaign to scrap the 1824 Vagrancy Act has received Labour party support.


Responding to the announcement, Ms Moran said ""The 1824 Vagrancy Act is a heartless, Dickensian law that is shamefully still being used thousands of times a year by police forces - including to try and remove homeless people from the streets of Windsor ahead of the Royal Wedding earlier this year.""


Ms Moran added ""Despite support from charities like Crisis and St Mungos, sadly the Government have - so far - failed to back my campaign and accept my Vagrancy (Repeal) Bill to axe this legislation. I hope that this growing support from the Labour party will help to convince the Government to do the right thing. Scotland and Northern Ireland have already repealed the law. England must follow and axe this cruel, outdated legislation which allows the Police to arrest those sleeping rough or begging even if they aren't doing any harm.""Did you know you can register to get updates from Mayor Dave Hodgson and the local Liberal Democrats?You can do so at https://bedfordlibdems.org.uk/en/petition/email-updatesAfter the Christmas celebrations are over and all the decorations are down don't forget to recycle your real Christmas tree.25 tonnes of real Christmas trees were collected from the Council's collection points across Bedford Borough last year; make sure yours is one of the lucky ones sent for composting.Merry Christmas from everyone at Bedford Liberal DemocratsMayor Dave Hodgson and Bedford Borough Council have acted swiftly to protect local bus users from Stagecoach cuts described by Mayor Dave as 'unacceptable'.Stagecoach announced changes to local bus timetables starting from 30th December 2018 which will lead to disruption and delays, particularly for those travelling from Cotton End and Shortstown and for users of the number 51 between Rushden and Oakley, through to Bedford.For an afternoon or evening out for all the family, why not go to the Pantomime Aladdin at the Corn Exchange. It runs from Saturday 22nd December to Tuesday 1st January, 2pm and 6pm matinees available.

REQUALLOOnline QDA is a set of learning materials which address common issues of undertaking qualitative data analysis (QDA)  and beginning to use Computer Assisted Qualitative Data AnalysiS  (CAQDAS) packages. We aim to complement courses run by, for example, the CAQDAS Networking project, many independent trainers and the large number of undergraduate and postgraduate social sciences research methods training courses.Materials consist of text pages outlining issues and aspects of analysis and the approaches and theories found in qualitative research along with tutorials with audio and video materials. The Intro section explains how the information and tutorials are arranged and makes some suggestions about how to use this site.We hope that members of the qualitative research community will not only find this material useful, but also will wish to contribute material of their own. This may vary from short reviews of books and web sites to more substantial essays and training materials. Please get in touch with us if you wish to contribute.The CAQDAS Networking Project resource is closely connected with Online QDA. Resources have been developed in close collaboration and are intended to provide a rounded service to qualitative researchers. The Online QDA site provides support for learning a range of qualitative data analysis approaches with some materials to support getting started with CAQDAS.The CAQDAS Networking Project resource concerns itself with the use of software to assist in the processes of qualitative data analysis.  In particular it aims to provide researchers with face to face training events at introductory level and online resources which will enable simple/complex and innovative aspects of data integration and project design to be considered and planned.The appearance of the CAQDAS Networking Project logo  on pages in this site will indicate a link to the more advanced materials on the CAQDAS site.The resources on this site by Graham R Gibbs, Dawn Clarke, Celia Taylor, Christina Silver and Ann Lewins are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.The initial development was funded by the UK Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of its Research Methods Programme which aims to improve the standards of research methods across the UK social science community. ESRC GRANT RES-333-25-0009.Researchers:This project ran from August 2007 to December 2010, and  produced  case study exemplars of data and explications
      of the analytic procedures from recent, real research projects. Resources  include data from the research project’s
      interviews or ethnographies, video interviews with the respective researchers, examples of different stages of the analysis
      and interactive, web-based exercises. They are usable at a range of student levels, from first year undergraduate to
      master’s. This material is available to teachers of QDA in electronic form. By producing them as reusable learning

Why extend your lease?Leases run out. You may think a lease with 60 or 70 years is fine but wait until you try and sell it. The harsh reality is that it's hard to sell a lease with less than 80 years left to run. The reason is simply because it costs a lot more to renew a lease with 80 or less years left than a longer lease. If a lease has more than 80 years to run it may only cost a few thousand to renew it. But if it has les than 80 years the freeholder is entitled to a share of the extra value arising from the lease extension. So the cost may increase to £15,000 or £20,000 or more. if you ( or your parents) own a flat or leasehold house or are thinking of buying a property with a lease with less than 85 years left to run, talk to us now.If you are a first time buyer and want a solicitor who can patiently guide you through the whole process call us.If you are buying or selling for the second, third or fourth time and have been disappointed by the service you got from one of the big conveyancing factory firms, try us. We provide a personal service. All our conveyancing work is done by experienced, qualified solicitors. We've been doing it for over 35 years. We know what to do to make things happen and how to protect you from the worst of the irritations.Call 020 3633 4060.Why leave it all to chance? Young or old, making a Will makes sense.A will ensures your property goes to the people you want to have it. For example, without a Will an unmarried partner gets nothing. There is no such thing as a common law marriage! If you die young leaving children, it allows you to name who will be their guardians. A will helps avoids arguments and family disputes. It can save your family paying too much Inheritance Tax. It gives you peace of mind. And if you are unlucky enough to die young leaving children, it allows you to name who will be their guardians.It's simple to do and it's not expensive. a standard Will is £250 plus VAT. Just call us and we can talk you through what you need to do.Inheritance Tax hits anyone who leaves more than £325,000. The tax rate is 40%. That means almost everyone who owns a property in London is likely to be subject to it. But a little planning ahead could save your family paying more IHT than they need to on your passing. If you'd prefer your life's savings to go to your family, friends or charity instead of the Government, talk to us.A married couple or Civil Partners can leave as much as they want to each other tax free. But that only delays the bill as IHT will still have to be paid on the second death. 
									
If you would like us to advise you or have any questions phone us on  020 3633 4060.Can you protect your family home from Care Home Fees? 
									Despite paying tax and National Insurance all your working life, when you finally need help from the Government with Nursing Home fees, it often isn't there. If you have assets worth more than £23,500 you will get no help. And that £23,500 is not just savings, it includes most things of value you may own including your home. But there are exceptions and things you may be able to do to safeguard your property provided you do them in good time. If you, your spouse / partner (or your parents) think there is a risk of needing residential care at sometime in the next few years talk to us now. If you wait until you have to go into care it will be to late to safeguard your home from the cost. Talk to us now.If you are thinking of buying or selling a shop, restaurant or office, speak to us before you do anything else.If you are buying, remember, leases are drafted by the landlords solicitors and are often unfair.Should you buy in your own name or a company's? Do you have to pay towards the Landlord's legal fees? Can you negotiate a rent free period to cover renovation costs?If you selling you usually need the freeholders consent and you might be asked to give a guarantee for the the new tenants future rent payments and good behaviour.Remember, leases can be legal minefields.

It provides young people, from 6 years of age upwards, a wealth of opportunity to develop and grow.For more information on Scouting in the UK please visit the official website of the Scout Association:ScoutsScouting Resources is an 'unofficial' site run by a dedicated leader in the UK Scouting movement. It aims to provide information, ideas and resources that are not easily obtainable elsewhere.While I may not have had a great deal of spare time to upload some of the vast amount of Scouting resources I have, the site and myself are still very much alive and kicking. I hope to be thinking about some changes on here over the summer. At the moment I am toying with a new look and a move to some more managed system (up until now Scouting Resources has been completely handcoded in html).Scouting Resources - new lookTake a look and tell me what you think. It is early days yet so features and pages will be added, layout and colours will be tweaked.Scouting Resources can provide a useful source of information for scouters and scouts alike. With basic introductions and information on all the major Scouting skills and some detailed work and information on specific areas it can form the basis of your own work.The site offers a good deal of material on the more 'traditional Scouting skills such as Map, Compass, Camping, Knots and Pioneering. These include pictures and 'tutorials' on the major subject areas and the Links section can provide an excellent selection of links to further information.The Scouting programme is well catered for with sections on Weather, Codes, Signs, Countries, Cultures and the Jungle Book.Part of the unique attraction of scouting are those things that you rarely get a chance to experience elsewhere. Remember how much fun your first Campfire was? With hundreds of Campfire songs and Stunts and Skits you can keep the campfire magic going. Even when you have exhausted these you can get your hands on hundreds more from the Links section. This is equally true for Games, Scout Leaders need never be hard pressed for a game idea again.There is information for the leaders among us too. You can take a look at the Downloads section and see what you might find useful in your group. The Ideabase holds a few good ideas and the Links section links you to thousands more.If all else fails you can contact us to ask for help from the Swapshop or the Contact page.Interested in joining Scouting?

GBdirect staff were providing open source support services long before the
company’s incorporation in 1995, and we’ve been offering Linux
support since we migrated our own infrastructure to Linux way back in 1998.Until recently, however, most of our open source software support focused on
applications or systems that we had a hand in designing, writing, building,
installing or integrating, i.e. a relatively specialised, hand-crafted,
service.In response to customer demand and to the increasing maturity of the open
source software market, we are now offering Linux support and open source
software support in simpler, packaged, formats, i.e. our open source
maintenance contracts are now what are known in the awful jargon of our times
as ‘support solutions’.As time allows, we will detail our range of open source support
‘solutions’ on pages shown in the indented section of the left hand
menu.  In the meantime, this page will serve as a general introduction to our
maintenance offerings; providing an outline of the major open source packages
supported, the different forms of open source support available, models of
delivery and basic cost structures.In fast developing technologies like Linux and open source, experience
counts for even more than it does in older and more mature markets.
Recent converts to Linux and open source, however prestigious their name and
reputation, are unlikely to have the depth of knowledge and experience to
efficiently address the most common requirement for Linux and open source
support, i.e. serious troubleshooting skills. This depth of
experience is, however, precisely what long-term open source experts like
GBdirect and its associates can provide.For most companies information technology (IT/ICT) is simply a means to an
end.  Economic logic dictates that many will retain technical staff to meet
routine day-to-day exigencies, but use external support to tackle those
situations which are too occasional to justify the cost of retaining in-house
experts, e.g. catastrophic failure, security threat, upgrade,
extension/customisation, migration, or the like.One of the principal reasons for the growth of open source software is its
affinity with this business model.  The big name open source packages (e.g.
Apache, Bind and Sendmail) are typically robust, stable and infrastructural in
nature. They are usually installed and configured just once, then run and run
without interruption or maintenance until they are either retired or redirected
towards new tasks and functions.Most open source packages of this kind are written by and for experts, with
the unfortunate side-effect that accessible documentation for new users
(including the technically skilled users) can be hard to find.  As a
consequence, even experienced contractors can be hard-pushed to find a quick
and lasting solution to open source problems if they lack deep knowledge of
system internals and the familiarity to read and modify source code with
confidence.  The technical principles may be same as those on other systems,
but the practice of maintenance can be rather different.If you are considering an alternative supplier of Linux support or open
source support, remember to ask them how much of their own business runs on
open source, and how long they’ve depended on it for their livelihoods.
Every application in our company, bar one, has run on open source software
since 1998.  The accounts package’s days are numbered, unless Sage comes
up with a Linux port fairly soon.One notable difference from the proprietary model of software support is
that very few open source applications have a single commercial provider or
distribution channel.  In many cases, traditional proprietary methods of
escalating support simply become redundant.When a package author has no economic or legal obligation to his/her users,
no amount of channel pressure may be enough to secure end-user driven changes
from him/her.  On the other hand, open source licencing permits skilled third
parties, like GBdirect, to modify his/her packages in whichever way their
clients see fit.In effect, providers of open source support can completely short-circuit the
escalation procedures of the traditional channel, delivering a fast one-stop
shop solution.  If a client needs an answer, a new feature, or a fix, we can
get it straight from the author or we can simply provide it ourselves, without
time consuming conditions, qualifications and referrals up the chain.Another difference is that the modular, component-based, character of open
source software multiplies the potential external dependencies in a package;
requiring open source support companies to draw upon a wider range of skills
and knowledge than traditional ‘solutions providers’ typically have
to hand.This is why the support company’s embeddedness in open source
communities and ecosystems should matter to the end-user.  Companies that have
worked in this enviroment for years have networks of mutual support which are
both wider and deeper than you are ever likely to find in a proprietary
channel, i.e. in addition to being vertically integrated with their own
suppliers and resellers, open source support companies are horizontally
integrated with an entire community, including direct competitors.  In effect,
the end-user user’s support contract with a single company like GBdirect
allows that user to tap into the skills and knowledge of individuals inside
dozens of other companies.The economic paradox here is that open source support companies frequently
help themselves by helping their competitors. By sharing skills, they enable
one another to offer better and cheaper services than the mutually exclusive
channels of the proprietary world.GBdirect take this practice of co-operation for mutual competitive advantage
to a further level.  Not only do we consult experts in competitor companies, we
also sell their expertise directly to our clients (even when we have similar
in-house skills).  This allows us to provide a quality, quantity, range and
depth of open source software support which even some of consulting
‘giants’ would be hard-pushed to match.Moreover, we can offer high quality service at competitive prices, because
neither we nor our customers carry the full burden of risk typically associated
with immature, fast changing, markets.  If, for whatever reason, we or our
partners should be pressed to meet a support obligation at a particular moment,
our other associates are committed to pick-up the slack.  In effect, by sharing
a necessary minimum of spare capacity between us, we reduce the total amount
required (and, hence, the cost to each of us of maintaining it).Software support can mean a great many different things, indeed there are
even international standards which identify dozens of different categories and
service levels.  In the real world, however, distinctions between factors like
maintenance, customisation, integration, software development, etc. are hard to
draw and none-too-relevant for the commercial goals of a business.GBdirect’s recognises that support of one kind tends to overflow into
another and organises it’s services accordingly.  Insofar as they are
necessary at all, transitions between one level or type of GBdirect support and
another are seamless.With the exception of initial incident reporting, helpdesk support is
typically provided by the same experienced software developers and system
administrators who provide our remote and onsite intervention services.  These
technical experts really are as comfortable answering end-user queries as they
are editing source code.On the rare occasions that an issue extends beyond the first
individual’s field of knowledge, it is automatically passed to an
established expert in the domain, without the need for any formal escalation or
referral.  The same procedure applies whether the experts involved are GBdirect
associates or members of the company’s permanent staff.  Needless to say,
more bureacratically formal procedures are available to those who prefer
them.Although they can be structured in different ways, our charges simply
reflect the amount of time taken by the relevant expert to address the
problems covered by a support contract.Our two broad categories of support are:Most of our clients combine the two; relying on the helpdesk to deal with
the vast majority of incidents, but retaining the option to invoke direct
intervention in exceptional circumstances.This form of open source software support is designed primarily for those
who would expect their own technical staff to handle everyday problems, i.e.
it backs-up and extends in-house resources when they are approaching their
limits.For relatively simple, or standalone applications, helpdesk support may also
be used to back-up comparatively unskilled (non-technical) staff with
responsibility for software maintenance in smaller businesses.Larger clients may provide the first line of helpdesk support themselves
(e.g. sourcing it from a hardware supplier), using GBdirect’s helpdesk to
provide expert and guru level back-up.We can, however, provide direct front line support for those who require
it.Helpdesk support is normally staffed within office hours, but 24x7 support
can be arranged as appropriate.Pricing usually involves a relatively modest annual fee based on the number,
scale and type of software systems involved, plus charges for the exact amount
of helpdesk time used in a given period.  For accounting convenience, some
customers prefer to pay a single consolidated charge for a fixed amount of
annual helpdesk time (with higher rates for any excess).  While this is usually
the more expensive option, we are happy to provide quotes for either form of
payment.This form of open source support essentially involves GBdirect staff and
associates directly monitoring, configuring or managing your software systems,
rather than merely advising your own technical staff on the matter.  Obviously,
the extent of that intervention is an issue for mutual discussion and
agreement.  It is most commonly invoked to cover emergencies and one-off system
changes.Most clients will employ this form of support alongside a helpdesk service,
rather as a complete alternative to it.  Some will, however, simply opt for a
fully managed service in which the helpdesk fulfills the residual function of
logging incident reports.Routine intervention is most commonly delivered through remote management
software and secure shell access, but all contracts provide the option of
invoking onsite support when these are impracticable or undesirable.New customers often choose a low cost package which provides remote
intervention during office hours within a single annual fee and charges for
exceptional onsite support during working hours based on our standard
consulting rates.Larger companies may employ such support as a means of evaluating our
performance on ‘edge’ services before purchasing it for other
systems.Intervention support (onsite or remote) can be provided out of office hours
and for a single consolidated annual fee, subject to negotiation.  As with
helpdesk support, the single flat rate option is essentially for those who
prefer predictability over the fine-grained savings that come with payment for
exact work done.The precise charges for intervention support vary (depending on the scale
and complexity of the systems concerned), but are essentially proportional to
the cost of staff time we actually devote to the it.  Managed services are an
obvious exception, where charges also reflect the cost of holding staff
available for contingencies which may not actually occurThe following list is far from exhaustive.  It is mostly a list of the open
source applications that our full-time staff have historically supported and
maintained.  There are many other OSS applications which we and our associates
have some experience of maintaining, but which we have not listed (e.g. because
they are either relatively immature, are subject to dramatic change, or of
purely minority interest) . A number of newer cross platform and
‘cross-over’ applications, particularly those associated with the
proprietary Java and .Net frameworks belong in this category.If you have an open source application which needs support, and isn’t
on the following list, just get in touch.  If it’s not something our
full-time staff specialise in, there’s still a very good chance that it
is covered by one or more of our associates." 6588.0 0.0 "Open Source Software Support, Open Source Support Services and Linux Support"

Gegen TierversucheEntstehung des Deutschen TierschutzvereinsDer Deutsche Tierschutzverein wurde 1881 gegründet. Zahlreiche Tierheime und Tierschutzvereine kamen zu dem Entschluss, dass eine Organisation benötigt wurde, die über allen kleineren Institutionen steht und für alle Menschen Deutschlands offen steht. Schließlich sollten die Tiere der verschiedenen Regionen geschützt werden.Und dieser Schutz konnte nur durch eine nationale Gemeinschaft der Tierschützer gewährleistet werden.Der Deutsche Tierschutzverein ist auch heute noch aktiv. Von seinem Sitz in Bonn aus organisiert der Verein den Tierschutz Deutschlands.Über 730 regionale Tierschutzvereine aus den 16 Bundesländern unterstützen den Deutschen Tierschutzverein kräftig. Innerhalb der letzten Jahre kam es zur Gründung von mehr als 520 Tierheimen, die zum Eigentum des Vereins zählen.Und auch das Engagement der Tierschützer ist groß. Auf freiwilliger und beruflicher Ebene setzen sich mittlerweile über 800.000 Menschen für die Ideale des Deutschen Tierschutzvereins ein.Die heutige Organisation des VereinsBei solch einer großen Zahl von Mitarbeitern und Niederlassungen in ganz Deutschlands, benötigt der Deutsche Tierschutzverein natürlich eine gute Führung. Diese übernimmt Präsident Wolfgang Apel zurzeit.Die Ziele und Ideale des Vereins werden in einer Art Satzung zusammengefasst.Diese trägt dazu bei, dass sich auch Außenstehende über die Intentionen des Vereins informieren können.Die Hauptaussagen dieser Satzung sind folgende:"" Jedes Mitgeschöpf hat Anspruch auf Unversehrtheit und ein artgerechtes Leben. Wir wollen, dass dieser Anspruch für alle Tiere verwirklicht wird – in der Wirtschaft, der Forschung, im Privathaushalt und wo immer der Mensch mit Tieren Umgang hat.""Der Deutsche Tierschutzverein ist nicht nur direkt für die Tiere da, sondern wirkt auch unmittelbar in der Politik mit. Er ist beim Deutschen Bundestag in der Liste der Lobbyverbände registriert. Auf diese Weise gelingt eine politische Partizipation. Diese ist auch für den Verein besonders wichtig. Denn über den Lobbyismus haben Verbände und Vereine die Möglichkeit, sowohl Exekutive, als auch Legislative zu beeinflussen. Auf diese Weise können Interessen auf politischer und gesellschaftlicher Ebene artikuliert werden.Und diese Interessenpolitik wird vom Deutschen Tierschutzverein seit 2008 betrieben. Der Lobbyismus des Vereins wird in erster Linie von dem Hauptstadtbüro in Berlin betrieben. Aufgrund der idealen Standortbedingungen ist eine Kommunikation mit dem Parlament und den Ministerien sehr gut möglich!Copyright by vivisection-absurd.org.uk" 7554.0 0.0 "Deutscher Tierschutzverein"

YOU MAY NEED OUR HELP...if you answer yes to any of these questions:We can help!By enabling you to pay your essential bills first, e.g. Mortgage, Gas, Electricity, Housekeeping, Travel Expenses, Telephone etc., we can work out how much money is available to pay your credit commitments. The figure is then paid to your creditors once a month to settle all your loans and other debts.Financial hardship can strike anybody at any time, regardless of social status. Experts argue numerous reasons for people sinking into the debt trap, from today's ""easy money society"" to increased interest rates and redundancy. Whatever the reasons, they all contribute towards financial problems and the resulting worry can be crippling both emotionally and practically becoming a vicious circle of rash decisions if not dealt with carefully.Times change - and attitudes with them. These days, borrowing money is too easy. Just take a walk down your local high street and you will be faced with dozens of opportunities to borrow money. I often hear people who have benefitted from our DebtBusters debt management programmes say that they have found it too easy to borrow ""just that little bit extra"" from a variety of sources, to keep up existing payments and consequently fall into the ""Debt Trap"".DebtBusters has become one of the largest independent debt counselling services in Britain and are experts in helping people who are experiencing acute money difficulties. Hundreds of people contact the DebtBusters Helpline every year and our counsellors talk to an average of 800 people per week. The service is totally independent of banks and other financial institutions and advice is completely confidential. DebtBusters is able to help clients defeat the debt trap and regain financial stability, providing they adhere to their debt management programme designed for them by our expert counsellors and maintain regular contact with us, advising us of any changes to their financial circumstances.Your initial telephone advice is free. We will have a confidential chat with you to see what can be done to help. It may be that this will be enough to set you on a self-help path to recovery. After all, it's never as bad as it seems! You may decide that we can offer you the expert help that you need by allowing us to recommend a suitable debt management programme that we will administer for you.In this case you will be introduced to your personal account manager who will remain with you throughout your programme. He will want as much information about your financial situation as possible. Only then, by having a full understanding of your circumstances, will he be able to recommend a tailor-made debt management programme to suit your ability to pay.Any information you give him will of course be treated in the strictest confidence and you will always communicate directly with him through to the completion of the programme.For more on the Facebook Like Box, please visit Facebook's developer site.Share with...del.icio.usDiggFacebookMySpaceWindows LiveYahoo!

This record came out 20 years ago today. My copy is 20 years old. It is my most played and favourite record of all time. Everything about it is perfection. It's rock, it's pop, it's punk, it's grunge. The production is absolutely exquisite and the bass, oh the bass, best playing I've ever heard.  It is so much more than the sum of its popular singles & features my favourite lyrics of all time. It's also how I've come to know so many people in life and I couldn't be more thankful for that. It wasn't just a record to sit and listen to in your bedroom alone and keep to yourself, it got me out there, friends made, gigs seen, beers drunk, places & countries visited and the fansite we put up almost 20 years ago that still runs to this day (TVCY 4 LYF YO!) all because of this band & album. Very, very thankful for all of it, all because of this record.

This is due to the fact that some reactions do not happen immediately and also because a lot of vets simply will not admit that vaccines can be dangerous and therefore don’t associate them with the subsequent illness.7th Heaven have been highlighting the dangers of vaccines for years and leptospirosis vaccine is one of the ones with the most side effects including seizures, anaphylactic shock, blindness, the actual illness itself and death. It also contains the preservative thimerosal which consists of mercury, a highly toxic substance which should never be allowed in the body.In the article it states that the leptospirosis vaccine can give ‘immunity’ for up to a year. This, however, is totally untrue. At most it can give immunity for 2 weeks if at allIf your dog has suffered any adverse reaction after any vaccine please report it to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. NB you can also report any adverse reactions with Microchips to them too.Read the story in:TelegraphDaily MailNatural NewsRead the article by vet,Patricia Jordan.Report any adverse reactionsVeterinary Medicines DirectorateCharity Registration: NIC101696?HMRC Charity registration: XR65507Registered charity March 2003Keeping Pets In Homes7th Heaven Animal Rescue TrustSeventh HeavenYouTube" 9010.0 0.0 "7th Heaven Animal Rescue Trust"

We are a family business and have been making Club Fenders at Acres Farm, Berkshire for over 35 years - far longer than our competitors!. Every fender is made to measure and so no fireplace is too difficult to tackle. The fenders are produced here at Acres Farm, Berkshire by our own skilled team. We use up-to-date equipment, but the methods of manufacture, selection of the finest materials and emphasis on quality above all else are in the highest tradition of British workmanship. We offer an enormous range of styles and finishes (Hand antiqued brass, hand bronzed brass, brushed/polished solid stainless steel or stove enamelled paint finish), a broad choice of leathers, and a wide selection of materials (e.g. solid brass, wood, stove enamelled steel, clear cast acrylic, or stainless steel) or any combination of these.  Our stainless steel/brass fenders are not stainless steel/brass finishes - they are made from solid stainless steel or solid brass. Plated fenders, even lacquered, do not survive long before being chipped by careless feet and exposing the plated steel inside to rust! If they aren’t lacquered then they will be fully exposed. Our fender prices are all inclusive - in other words the basic cost of a fender includes leather seats, spaced studs around the seats, solid metal uprights and collars (collars are needed to spread the weight and so not compress the formed base). Please peruse our website for more detail or telephone us.Please click on the button below to see how to order. The price for a complete fender, upholstered in leather, starts from just £995* (plus VAT) *Inside dimensions of the base up to 1525mmx600mm. See notes on order form.

 //-->The Akita Rescue & Welfare Trust (UK) - known informally as the ARW - was founded by a group dedicated Akita enthusiasts who felt there was a need for a society devoted to the rescue, welfare and protection of both the American and Japanese type of Akitas within the UK.The group decided from the beginning that not only was there a need of a rescue and re-homing service, but also that the breed needed a body who would be able to give unbiased opinions to the general public on the welfare and health aspects of this wonderful breed.The ARW now has reps and co-ordinators working across the country, advising owners, rescuing, re-homing and retraining Akitas. All members of the ARW work for the charity on a completely voluntary basis. This is a completely non-profit making organisation with no wage being taken by anyone and only minimal expenses being claimed where absolutely necessary.We assist in the re-homing of dogs from all UK rescue organisations such as the RSPCA, the Dogs Trust, Battersea Dogs' Home and many of the County Councils' dog pounds, as well as advising them on the correct way of assessing Akita temperament.The number of Akitas with problems being brought to our attention is currently growing day by day, which is a great concern to all of us at the ARW. The only way we feel we can reverse this trend is to go forward with our education programme in the hope that this may save the lives of some of our magnificent dogs.Summary & NotesThe Akita Rescue & Welfare Trust (UK) is a registered charity number 1112054.Code Ref:180200Name:BellaAge4 Year OldSex:FemaleNeutered:NoArea:LancashireNotes:Bella is a 4 year old female who is looking for her forever home.Bella is a lovely girl who is a-bit shy at first.

The Albacore is a great first boat for those who are just learning to sail and a very competitive racer for more advanced sailors. It is a fast and lively while being relatively easy to learn to sail and race. A fully adjustable rig and adjustable sail controls allow a crew to depower in high winds - enabling both light and heavy crews to race head to head. A very versatile boat, it is often sailed by husband/wife and parent child combinations. Those looking for a simple to learn, yet high performance sailing dinghy can join the ranks of Albacore sailors who come from all walks of life and range in age from teenagers to masters pushing 80 years of experience. The Albacore is a boat that is both simple to get into at first, and one which will challenge your tuning and tactical skills for the rest of your life.www.noblemarine.co.ukMcNamara Sails" 12233.0 0.0 Home

My friend from choir, David, who lives in Cornwall was up in Nottingham visiting friends, so I planned a dinner for a few of us. Our choir is from all over the UK and a bit further afield, so having a few of us together in one place is unusual except of course during choir week. One of my guests had alcohol- and gluten-free dietary requirements which meant no poached pears, no pastry, no pasta…We had…The mulled apple juice that I always do. For those that were drinking there was the offer of crab apple vodka to enliven it. I left out any ground spice, so it was just roasted apples, cardamom, star anise, cloves and a cinnamon stick, no mace or nutmeg, and it was much easier to serve with no grittiness.Then smoked mackerel pâté – essentially this BBC recipe but no horseradish and wholegrain instead of Dijon mustard, because that’s what was in the fridge. Served in espresso cups with oat cakes and crispbreads that were naturally gluten free, and with an antipasti jar of roasted peppers and some almond stuffed olives.Nigella’s chicken shawarma, that I wrote about recently here. I forgot to buy yoghurt, although I went out of my way to get pomegranate seeds. I asked my guests to pick up yoghurt on their way and then forgot to do anything with it. Served with salad, cucumbers and tomatoes, and hasselback potatoes.For pudding was vanilla crème brûlée – a trial run in the week had shown me that you need to leave them in the oven for almost double the time in the recipe to get a set custard rather than a liquid vanilla cream. A garnish of a slice of kiwi and a fanned strawberry – the strawberries were so unseasonal they crunched like carrots when sliced. This is a very simple thing to make, just four ingredients. The only faff is owning a blow torch. I brought them to the table and let my guests brûlée their own crème, which all seemed to enjoy.With coffee I made white chocolate salami again. This time it came out really well. Such a simple thing to make, looks really impressive. In it, I put a half a bag of shelled pistachios, some chopped glacé cherries and some chopped dried apricots.I did boast at one point that no individual dish took more than about 10 minutes to make – some of them longer to cook and marinate etc, but only a few minutes of my time. Cleaning and tidying the house, however…Just over a year after coming home, one of the rescue ladies from the battery farm died, so this has necessitated more birds for the hen house.I went back to  Hens4Pets to get two hybrid birds, a Magpie (black) and an Amber (white).  When they asked what I was looking for, I just said “not brown.” It’s good to have birds you can easily disambiguate.They’ve been with me a couple of weeks now, settling in. The pecking order is very clear and the old ex battery Attila the Hen is not letting the new birds eat from the feeders, just the corn on the ground. This is when I’m standing there, anyway. Given that all of the food is going, the new birds must be able to manage to eat some of it when Attila is not looking.The new ladies in the coop reminded me of some common chicken behaviour that the battery birds have never learnt to do. They dig through the ground. They fly up to the perches. They dust-bathe. Attila just doesn’t do those things. I’d forgotten that was odd.On the whole the ex-battery hens have not been great. They haven’t laid well. The eggs they have provided have had extremely thin shells. Towards the end I’d resorted to paying for eggs and chicken feed, and that’s not how it’s supposed to work.Attila is not laying, but the new black chicken is very consistent and provides a tiny egg every day.(eating leftover pomegranate from pudding club.)Look how overgrown the coop is now compared to when it was built five years ago!Three recipes cooked for pudding club so far in 2018, none of them blogged! #thehorrorAt the start of the year, I was very taken with the new  Mary Berry TV series and there were a few things I wanted to cook. Her truffle chocolate pots looked super – a chocolate mousse with some of the mousse reserved and magicked into truffles to put on top. The recipe and her photos are here.The mousse component was fine.  I mean, sure, it’s a faffy way of getting a food processor dirty to make a mousse – previously I have whisked the egg whites and folded into melted chocolate + yolks instead, but that’s not entirely safe if you might be feeding the immunosuppressed.But the recipe for the truffles on top just didn’t work.For starters the centres were incredibly sticky and refused to be rolled without extreme fridging and adding in extra icing sugar and cocoa.And then just dipping them in molten white chocolate to get a shell…Really, you need to temper chocolate to make it do that. And that’s nowhere in the recipe.The final pot was delicious, but I totally failed to make it pretty. (Story of my cooking!)For my next triumph, I made a chocolate cake in a frying pan!No, I can’t remember why, either, but it was quite nice. The recipe had an interesting frosting and some interesting questions about American recipes. What is “Dutch” cocoa for example? We thought it was probably something to do with the difference between what we in the UK would call cocoa and drinking chocolate. I just used Bourneville. To make matters worse, the frosting calls for quality milk chocolate and I just used Dairy Milk. You could taste that it was Dairy Milk in the finished article and although we all knew that was bad, it turned out to be quite a nostalgic flavour for us all.I also forgot to take any pictures, apparently…?For our most recent outing to Pudding Club, my hosts provided this awesome Baked Alaska as the pudding, so I made the main course for a change.I had previously halved the ingredients and just done the chicken component of Nigella’s Chicken Shawarma as a midweek supper; but this time, I bought everything needed for  the sides as well, including things that didn’t sound like I would especially like them… pomegranate seed bejewelled tahini flavoured yoghurt? But it turned out lovely, actually.The chicken by itself had garnered a “you can make that again”, and it is fantastic, really delicious. The marinade is not hard, but it does have quite a lot of ingredients, and ideally you need to do it the day before. Getting the seeds out of the pomegranate is fun. Whack! whack!  Now, what to do with the rest of the jar of tahini?!  (Quick google, and these catch my eye: cookies, salmon, lamb, peanut hummus!)This paprika smells wonderful and I am looking for excuses to cook more with it:There’s lots of ingredients for the marinade but nothing is actually difficult. I left the coriander out because I don’t like it (tastes soapy to me) and so don’t have any.Overnight in fridgeHot oven for 30 minutes, then serve on a bed of lettuce and drizzle over the oily juices.  Unless you are, as Nigella says, for some inexplicable reason, anti-oily-juices.Serve with salad and a pomegranate/yoghurt/tahini dip.A break with tradition and I’m telling you about some recent books wot I have read, and it’s not the end of the summer holidays.  I hardly manage to read books these days – and what I’m saying with that is that I don’t make it enough of a priority. As a friend said at work: you manage to find hours to spend with your phone. I have a few mental pictures of the life I’d like to lead – in bed by 9.30 and reading for an hour; cooking Sunday lunch every week and sipping sherry to the Food Programme (empty your glass if you hear “Chorley-Wood bread process”).  The only thing stopping any of these things happening is me.The books below are books recommended to me that I have (mostly) totally enjoyed and want to pass on.My friends at work were raving about Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine. I think they were initially reluctant to recommend because it’s not classicly a boy book and it has been pigeonholed a bit as chick lit. I need to read about outside my comfort zone anyway (mostly nothing but crime!) and they did point out it was a short book and would not take me long.  Amazon’s Kindle preview thing lets you download the first chapter and see how you get along, so I read the first few pages on my phone in my classroom before going home one weekend – paid there and then and finished it in a couple of sittings – with kindle and pint in Wetherspoons running up to midnight on Friday night, and then in bed on Saturday morning.  It’s quite unlike anything I’ve ever read and it’s fab.  Eleanor is clearly on the spectrum and is a wonderful, spiky, unique, unreliable narrator.  The story unfolds with some complete bouleversements (hmm… is that not actually an English word?) unexpected changes in direction. It’s very hard to review without giving too much away, so you just have to read it, it’s amazing!My friends at pudding club were raving about Magpie Murders. So much so they didn’t let me leave without pushing it into my hands and saying you must read this!  I took it to France over Easter but didn’t have a chance to read it before returning, so took a day on bed after to do nothing but read and again polished this off in super quick time. It’s a return to crime fiction but again it’s a book that gives you unexpected twists. It’s a book within a book – most of the story is a crime novel by a character within the wider text – so just by flicking through it you see two different typefaces. The metatext has all sorts of fun games to play with the story within, and you get two crime narratives for the price of one. Again, highly recommended and puts me in mind of reading more Anthony Horowitz – I might even borrow some Alex Rider from the school library.Finally one of my friends from the language teachers who lunch collective recommended Holy Island by LJ Ross, and I’m sorry to say this is not something I would recommend at all. It’s the first in a series of crime fic / police procedural with a lead character with a back story, DCI Ryan. I found the writing overblown and clunky and there’s an obvious, heavily signposted romance between the detective and a female cult expert bussed in from a nearby university which is completely at odds with common sense and lead me to some heavy eye rolling. Then, guess what, the woman finds herself in peril with the police officer battling the odds, the weather and the antagonist(s) in the heavy-handed dénouement. I’m not in any hurry to read any more, didn’t read the “first chapter in next book” that I got free with this one and I was very happy finally to finish this story after months of it clogging up my kindle.Coming up next – I moved straight from Holy Island to a welcome return to P D James – A Certain Justice, and will hopefully finish this afternoon, then I have been preparing some free sample chapters to see where we move next. Stephen Tall raved about Kate Atkinson so I’ve a chapter from one of her books. I heard a radio review of The Power and have been intrigued by the premise for months – “Suddenly – tomorrow or the day after – teenage girls find that with a flick of their fingers, they can inflict agonizing pain and even death.” – how different would the world be if no-one could argue with or abuse teenage girls!? An interview in the Guardian with David Sedaris has a throwaway recommendation for a book by Rebecca Front – he doesn’t appear to know who she is!  Someone – I now can’t remember who – recommended Mythago Wood, but it’s set in Herefordshire, so that’s reason enough to read it too.Popped across to France during the Easter holidays for slightly less than a week at HPB Manoir du Hilguy in the outskirts of Quimper, the capital of Brittany on the west coast of France.Booked at short notice, we were due to stay Wednesday to Wednesday, so the first surprise of the holiday was that there are no night sailings into Roscoff or St Malo on Wednesdays with Brittany Ferries – of all their long channel crossings, only Portsmouth-Caen runs on Wednesday nights. So the crossing out was nearly fully booked and we could only get reclining seats, not a cabin; and there was a long drive across the top of France to get to digs on the first day.Travelling in through Normandy had its advantages too – my companion had never been to this part of the world before so it opened up opportunities for me to revisit some of the treasures of Normandy again. On the way from Caen to Quimper, we stopped off at the Bayeux tapestry. I have seen this before but could remember nothing of it, so was very happy to troll around the embroidery again. I had completely forgotten the cause of the Norman invasion in the years running up to it – Harald swearing and reneging on an oath – and all the filthy rude pictures around the edges were entertaining too.A bit of a running theme throughout the visit was value for money. We felt many things of equivalent cultural importance in the UK would cost an awful lot more to visit. The thousand-year-old treasure of the first cost us under a tenner to see.A second running theme though is opening hours and availability. Lots of the things we were interested in were not yet open for the season. Of all the HPB properties, only Hilguy is shut down for the winter, because not enough people visit to make it viable to keep open. But you can kinda see why – the weather forecast was terrible for our visit and many of the attractions in that part of the world are only open June-September.On our way from Bayeux to Quimper, I took T to see the Château de Balleroy, Normandy home of the Forbes magnate. We could only glimpse through the gates as the castle doesn’t start doing visits until April.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40541680964/Long drive onwards, arrived at Hilguy early afternoon. Quick nap, evening meal in the bistro onsite, long sleep.First full day, after a lie in, leisurely breakfast and first experience with the Hilguy bread delivery (it’s awesome tasty bread, but you have to get to reception early enough in the afternoon to order it!) out to Quimper, a beautiful city with tricky parking. We found a space immediately in a car park across the river from the cathedral, but could only stop there for a few hours, on threat of high fines if you overstay your time by only a minute. We had better than expected weather which allowed us to walk the streets, including the Rue des Gentilhommes …https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/27382604278…and Place au Beurre (Butter Square) – where there were at least 5 crêperies all doing good business.(I had been in this square 9 years previously but had no recollection of it.) We stopped in a delightful pancake shop which was very busy, full of French patrons, and had a delicious lunch. I was expecting to order a galette but the slightly frosty menu explained that this is a Norman thing – in Brittany, you have a crêpe au blé noir. I went for a “complète” and added creamy mushrooms – egg, ham, cheese, mushrooms.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40541630934/I also wanted a pudding so went for a pancake “au froment” – I wrongly assumed this meant fermented, but it’s just the French for wheat. They made their own caramels, so I had a coffee flavoured caramel pancake and it was da bomb.As we arrived the cathedral had been closed, but the doors were open after our lunch, so we went in for a visit. It’s dedicated to St Corentin of Quimper, a hermit who lived in the woods. He was blessed with a miraculous salmon that jumped out of a fountain at his prayer, and miraculously replaced any flesh that was sliced off it.  The wikipedia page for the cathedral is incredibly detailed and helps as a guided tour.The cathedral has a kink in the middle, because they found they couldn’t put footings in the swamp when they were building it.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/27382601108/We visited on Good Friday, so the statues were veiled.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/41212520972/There was a fab bay with an interesting story of a pilgrim who had entrusted his fortune to a friend whilst off gallivanting. On his return, his friend had pretended not to know where the money was and refused to give it back. There was a tribunal when his friend continued his lies in front of lay judges. At this point a statue of the crucifix began bleeding, and the friend gave the money back. The bay had a stained glass window depicting this, as well as a reliquary holding the head of the mediaeval statue which bled, and the cloth it bled onto.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40360146775/in/album-72157693542634361/Out of the cathedral, with the parking clock ticking, we had a choice between a fine art museum and a museum of Breton life, and chose the latter, in the Bishop’s Palace right next door. Lots of lovely furniture, ceramics and costumes, including lots of information about Breton women’s headdresses. An exhibition of a female illustrator of children’s books and her other paintings.Back to car, supermarket trip, home, dinner.  It was Good Friday and the TV ads had been banging on about lamb for weeks, so I bought a leg of lamb with the intention of roasting it one night and using the leftovers for shepherd’s pie on another occasion.The second day, we were in pursuit of a nice castle, but were hampered in that a lot of the obvious places to try were not yet open for the season, or closed because of Easter. One in particular was Keriolet, “a Russian princess’s dream” but we didn’t get to go there at all. At reception, they explained that Brittany was a poorer region, not many châteaux, many more manors.We eventually set out for the Domaine du Trévarez – I didn’t know much about it on the way. We arrived before it opened for the afternoon, so went for a bit of a drive, and walked around what felt like a ghost town of Châteauneuf du Faou, a town on a hill overlooking a bend in the river. We peeked around two churches and got back in the car.Trévarez felt like it was ready for a huge number of visitors – vast carparks – but we were the first to arrive and it felt like we had the place to ourselves.  It was built in the 1850s – at much the same time as the houses of Parliament and St Pancras, and had a similar sort of vibe. The architecture looked back to the 1700s but more modern techniques of construction were used, such as iron frames, and this was an early example of electricity (powered from a steam generator in the stable block), central heating, and fully indoor plumbing. The exterior of the castle had been perfectly restored, but the interior was very limited, and showed the damage done as the Allies bombed it in 1944, to try and remove the Nazis who had set up shop there.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40360050555/https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/27382470618/The gardens were amazing, with heather and camellias in abundance.There was a nice caff with some trad Breton cakes and biscuits.We snacked on cheese and salad, and delicious pots à la crème which I always look out for in France.April 1st, Easter Sunday, was the worst of the weather, so we set a course for Brest, and the largely indoor Océanopolis, a massive aquarium. I had been there before, before I became a teacher, and was hugely struck to find “bassin de requins” – shark pool – a phrase I use in my teaching. I must have internalised it last time I was there.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/41255839081/in/album-72157693542634361/There are three pavilions – tropical and coral, arctic and local – with long exhibitions around each of these themes. It’s not perfect for a wet weather day as there are still uncovered walks from the car park to the tanks and between each various bit but it was the best way to spend a day with really atrocious rain.We came back via the bakery Paul just outside the aquarium for a late lunch, and in the evening availed ourselves of the wood-fired pizza van which visited site.Monday we visited Concarneau, an extremely picturesque fishing town. The Old Port is a walled fortress with ramparts, and the sun came out while we were there.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/41255630791/in/album-72157693542634361/The Old Port itself is a real tourist trap with lots of ice-cream and sweet shops, and the last word in knick-knackery and Breton tourist tat.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/27382035728/in/album-72157693542634361/We took a slow route home via Pont l’Abbé where we visited a brocante, a statue and a looked at the strange tower on the church.Also a statue of five ages of women all mourning dead sailor fishermen fathers and husbands.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40359473625/in/album-72157693542634361/We also took in a classic Breton beach with impressive kite surfers, and tried to imagine how nice it would be at the height of summer.We drove over a huge viaduct over an inlet and stopped to walk back over it to take photos.Tuesday we started at Audierne for a bit of a wander – churches, graveyards, marinas, delicious crêpes where I was a bit more adventurous with ingredients.Then on to the Pointe du Raz – not quite the most westerly point of France, but very close. Very picturesque coastal walk.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/26382946507/Statue of Our Lady of the Shipwreckedhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40540846694/in/album-72157693542634361/Down the road from the Pointe du Raz is the most gorgeous Baie des trépassés – we came down to sunshine, shelter from the wind at the cliff top, but huge green waves and surfer dudes taking advantage.Then to a flying visit to Dournanez. Another place I could not remember, but on return, found I had taken almost identical photos. We arrived too late, but there is a shipping museum here where you can walk around the boats, based on the town’s vital sardine industry.Our final day was the long drive back to Caen for the overnight ferry, but with 12 hours to kill between being kicked out of digs near Quimper and checking in at Ouistreham.Before we left we took some final pics of the manor.https://www.flickr.com/photos/niles/40359691825/Four hours driving was split up with a visit to Mont St Michel. Again, I place I have visited before but have little memory of. I think in my mind I was muddling the abbey at the top with another city… Prague perhaps? as what we saw up there rang no bells at all for me.  The ramparts and the tourist shops on the way up were familiar, but since the last time I went they have built some serious infrastructure – distant car parks and free shuttle busses were all new.  As with the Bayeux tapestry, visiting this world class, UNESCO monument, was actually not very expensive at all.We had had patchy weather on the drive, but the sun came out as we arrived so we got some fabulous photos.It started to rain as we were there but that more or less coincided with arriving at the abbey for the indoor part of the tour.The worst of rain was happening as they practised an evacuation drill – we were taken out of the Salle des Chevaliers down a staircase only used in emergencies and swept out of the building by women with “evac” armbands. Getting out of the building was the hardest part because people were extremely reluctant to leave given how hard it was raining.Our timetable allowed us a really brief visit to central Caen. I set the satnav for the Abbaye aux Hommes and we dove into the Hôtel de Ville car park with a plan for a quick walk and a nice bistro, but as we were leaving I saw a sign saying the car park closed at 8, so take your parking ticket with you. Unsure if that meant we would get the car trapped and be unable to catch the ferry, we ended up with a whistlestop tour around some of the monuments before heading out of town to Flunch for our last dinner in France.Something Olympic was going on at the Hôtel de Ville.Since I had not been able to get a cabin on the outward trip, I sprang for a luxury cabin – with a window! – for the return, and after a day of driving with another in prospect, it was a bit of a relief to be able to board the ferry, go the cabin, and just stay there all night!A colleague I share a class with set this task for one of my lessons with younger students. They seemed to enjoy it a lot and I have subsequently used it with KS4 students – and added a twist.It starts with a model answer to a 90 word GCSE question. You can either write your own, or I heartily recommend Kate Jones’s resources – her writing booklets have questions for every AQA theme and sub-topic, every style of question, and a full set of model answers.Start with your model answer. Remove sentences so that it only answers 3 bullet points.  Add in sentences that are not relevant. Print it big (eg big enough to fit 3 A4 sheets landscape) and cut it into strips*. Get kids to sort back into paragraph order.My most recent iteration of this task had a double sided worksheet with the mark scheme for a 90 word question on the back, and on the front, the question (in the target language, like in the exam) and a translation of the text they are aiming to build. Most students used this, and recognised at least one word per strip, which they could use to get their bearings through the paragraph, but the most able could hide this support and try to rebuild the sentences without it.The worksheet also had these tasks:* To speed up the cutting, you can prep the photocopier with a pile of coloured sheets in the bypass tray, eg 3 yellow, 3 blue, 3 pink, 3 orange. Copy onto those sheets then cut up all 12 in one go and separate  out by colour.Last weekend I threw the house open to the lovely people in my tower for our now annual Christmas social. We initially decided we ought to have a Christmas social but that everyone’s diary in December is too hectic, so we have ours in February instead.I like cooking for people and having people in my house but I actually don’t do it very often, so it’s nice to have an excuse.(Laid the table before counting properly AGAIN! and had to put an extra place setting in at the last minute.)I thought that the menu had not evolved much from last year, but looking back it seems I did simplify quite a bit.  I did the mulled apple juice again and offered some of the crab apple vodka to those who were both not driving and suitably aged.It’s been cold this year, so I didn’t want to do cold starters and desserts again, and so went for a slightly ambitious three cooked courses.  Crudités were still the main feature of the starter, then I was initially thinking fondue… but it would be hard to put the pot where everyone could reach it, so went for two separate baked camemberts so that each half of the table could reach. I was planning for 8 but one of us was ill on the night and we were 7 instead.  Two vegetarians amongst our numbers and I was conscious that anything properly called camembert is by AOC definition not vegetarian, so there was some hummus available instead.The mains as last year were baked potatoes with beans, cheese (veggie cheddar), sausages and Quorn sausages and homemade coleslaw.I actually took hardly any photos this year, but I did take quite a lot of the dessert. I was making Simon Hopkinson’s sticky toffee pudding – I blogged about it before in 2013 and the recipe is still on the BBC, and it’s still decadent and delicious. The basic recipe says serves 4, and the only way that is true is if you don’t eat anything else for an entire weekend.  I still doubled it and cooked it in a disposable foil roasting tin for a dessert that fed 7 people on the night, did doggy bags to take for absent partners, fed my neighbours who liked the photo on Facebook, and did me and T the following day.  I still have spare ingredients and I’m making it again today for half term pudding club tomorrow ?In its doubled up form you end up needing to buy over a litre of cream!The basic date sponge cooked the night before.With the first sticky toffee sauce poured over the top then put back under the grill.Loads of leftovers!I also made fudge – this Nigella recipe ish. There weren’t shelled pistachios available when I went shopping and I didn’t fancy shelling 150 grams myself, so I just used chopped hazelnuts. And glacé cherries, because why not?  And then, having made fudge, and having been given two boxes of After Eights… I forgot to bring either of them out with the tea and coffee! So there were loads leftover which made nice end of term gifts at school for colleagues instead as well as satisfying my own chocolate craving whenever I walk past the fridge." 12472.0 0.0 "Niles's Blog « Teaching, food and other random, infrequent wibblings"

Those who would like to understand more about the new term Staycation would most certainly be interested to know more about the much talked about Bridgend Driving school and riverside walks. Before getting into further details about this famous riverside walk, let us have some basic understanding about the new phrase Staycation. It is a combination of stay and vacation. This is because budgets have become tighter these days and getting on exotic holidays is becoming quite difficult. But that does not and should not prevent people for planning and enjoying holidays and visiting Bridgend Beauty Salon and also while you are there Bridgend Nail SalonBridgend is well known for its waterfronts and rivers which eventually drain out in to the sea. The biggest reason why Staycation in and around Bridgend is becoming so very popular is because of the extreme diversity that it offers. It has some of the most stunning landscapes and gorgeous river fronts and also beaches. The villages that lie hidden in between these fantastic landscapes is well and truly a great experience to say the least. It is also referred to as the Glamorgan Heritage Coast and it runs for 14 miles covering some of the most scenic places that perhaps nature can offer. It covers the Vale of Glamorgan and moves to Porthcawl further to the west. The entire area is dotted with majestic cliffs and golden sands and coves which are totally secluded and away from human civilisation.The best way to get started with this staycation it would be better to set base camp at Court Colman Manor. It is situated close to Bridgend. You could either trek or use a combination of trekking and cycling you so desire. Apart from the scenic beauty and the wide variety of flora and fauna that the entire course offers, there are also many places of historical significance that one should always keep in mind. The Dunraven Castle has lot of historical significance attached to it, though today most of it remains in ruins. It is not exactly a castle but more of a house that is well fortified. It is famous for its kitchen gardens and landing stage. The highly famous and much sought after Ogmore-by-Sea is another wonderful destination which will also fall in this route. It offers some of the most awesome view along the sea coast and you also could have a closer look at the estuary which leads to Porthcawl and Merthyr Mawr. The caves have quite a few wonderful new explorations to offer and the wide diversity of flora and fauna is simply amazing.As you move along the coast line, you could in many of the team rooms by the riverside. You could enjoy a cool drink and refresh and reenergise your body and mind as you move along. You will also be able to have a look at St. Donat’s Castle. Built in the 13th Century, the castle was held by De Haweys family. The castle was sold in 1925 to a millionaire newspaper businessman. It was eventually taken over by an international school, Atlantic College by name and this happened in the year 1960.

Sourcing the Best Vegan Perfume and Vegan CandlesIf you are searching for certain value for money perfumes then you’ll definitely discover the fact vegan perfume will not be expensive. None of the major parfum along with fragrance brand names in existence have grasped the actual thriving popularity associated with veganism perfectly which means that numerous smaller shops along with manufacturers currently have come along making excellent products in the meanwhile. Enhancing the small to mid-sized companies by purchasing their very own makes in vegan scents is really a significant emphasis for me that’s the reason for purchasing the main vegan fragrances.Firms that offer cruelty free perfumes only are those I look out for and 1 of those is without a doubt Dolma Perfumes nevertheless there are plenty of other ones also who supply simply vegan aromas. Choosing a exclusive bridal gift is usually tricky nevertheless I have literally began providing cruelty free parfum as presents just for him and her this has gone down nicely furthermore I’m endorsing cruelty free as well. Cruelty free perfume gift ideas are a brilliant way for you to surprise non vegans a little too, I’ve not had a single acquaintance who may have complained on obtaining an ethically sourced present, specially once I’ve told them how other brand names make and test their own scents upon wildlife.The simple truth is vegan candles and smells actually do without a doubt help to make a wonderful present and it isn’t going to make a difference if it turns out it is a marriage, birthday or anniversay everybody pretty much definitely seems to be delighted using them. The best way to uncover that perfect vegan present at present is to try using the internet and carry out a internet search that may churn to the top level for you personally an impressive report on the best novelties. You will find countless outstanding cruelty free providers and brands available on the market pretty much ready to offer a person with all the very best objects Walk diligently albeit while you are searching for the right business make certain they are undeniably cruelty free by looking to see if they are really credentialed with the major cruelty free assigned companies such as Leaping Bunny.When we’re looking into ethical gifts we’ll be looking into products which have had definitely nothing to do with any abuse of humans and also animals in the making of their goods. Being honest though equally refers to the particular natural environment and they companies have to confirm that their specific processes equally safeguard the actual environment.We always notice that whenever an organization follows ethical behavior they will likely address dilemmas like the economical public overall health and in addition earth-friendly environmental procedures. We very often look for the specific Fair Trade company logo when shopping for products and whenever you notice this specific symbol you’ll know the fact that the business making the entire goods has got directly into the practice of decreasing hardship and provides decent arrangements for employees that includes acceptable incomes.If you opt for a real vegan oriented solution then you can certainly be 100% confident it really is thoroughly free from any type of species mistreatment and also torture. There are several other considerations apart from vegan affable that you might want to review when searching for moral products and solutions. A subject frequently ignored is how all-natural fibres are being used within the styles sector. For example you may ask exactly what chemicals were used in the creation of the particular fibers included in the product. Exactly why you may possibly inquire is this a problem. It is obvious in fact because these chemicals enter into the atmosphere and could very well be hazardous towards the area ecosystem on top of that hazardous to individuals along with animals. You need to be getting environmentally friendly textiles when choosing merchandise because you then simply just know they’re honest." 15113.0 0.0 "- Sourcing the Best Vegan Perfume and Vegan Candles"

carrying out good quality geophysical surveys for individuals and organisations who wish to 
locate and investigate archaeological and historical sites.We also carry out surveys to try to ascertain whether a 
development site, pipeline or road route contains any remains as part of the 
Planning process.We use our own magnetometer and resistivity meter and can locate 
the surveys to within less than a metre using our own differential GPS equipment 
and, more accurately, using our total station.We have carried out surveys both in the UK and abroad since 
2004 and have worked for The National Trust, Oxford Archaeology, 
Edinburgh University and numerous other individuals and organisations.Whilst we try to keep the information on this website fairly 
accurate and up to date, some things may well go wrong.Please contact us should you spot any items which you think

Lincolnshire Open StudiosArt on the Map Exhibition Group is a collective of 25 high quality artists and craft makers which has evolved from the Lincolnshire Open Studios scheme, 
started back in 1999 when artists and craft-makers from across the county came together to put their studios ‘on the map’.Over the years a wide range of 
artists were part of the scheme and not only opened their studios to the public, but also came together for special exhibitions. The Open Studios scheme 
transformed into an Exhibiting Group in 2016 although it is still possible to visit many members’ studios and participate in workshops by appointment - 
see their details under the members' section on this website.The members continue to exhibit together around the county with a very successful exhibition 
in the Chapter House at the Lincolnshire Cathedral in summer 2016, a further exhibition planned for 1st -28th July 2017 at Gunby Hall and for August 2017 
at Stamford Arts Centre, and a return to Lincoln Cathedral in summer 2018. Contact secretary Sheila Pearce on 07850 553006

www.ashtav.org.ukJust another WordPress siteWhere we hold our seminars, the host society or council contributes a paper describing their town or vil lage, and some oftheir preoccupations We also publish a selection of other papers written for us from time to time, and we have included a number of cases where members have sought the Association’s help or support; in later editions we will report on the outcome and how new velopments have fitted into the area or affected the local community.One of our most popular publications in the Newsletter has been “What the Inspector Says”, the results of planning appeals proving very helpful to many members facing similar situations. However, our most ambitious project to date has been to enter the debate about future development, particularly in the shires in which reside most of our members. We publish a series of papers taking the view that the pressure for new develop ment in and around historic towns and villages will be enormous, despite the government’s emphasis on urban renewal. Indeed we have found that the attempt to increase brown field development endangers the integrity of many historic places unless really high quality building can be ensured. We will continue to contribute to the countryside versus city debate through this web site.The Association receives grant aid from English Heritage. With this grant we are improving our service to our members . Small towns and villages make an important contribution to the historic environment but they are also home to many hundreds of thousands of people whose interests we represent. We welcome new members from among the Parish and Town councils and from other organisations and individuals as Friends of the Association.Those who live in or visit Britain’s unique heritage of small historic towns and villages value them as an irreplaceable national asset. In each region they have their own special character and setting.Can we afford to lose this precious inheritance because of unsympathetic, unsuitable and out-of-scale development? Surely every effort must be made to preserve the essential character of these towns and villages for future generations. Their conservation is far more than a local matter. It touches the whole population, as well as visitors from all over the world. Indeed, the attractiveness of Britain’s historic towns and villages is an impor tant economic asset as well as an environmental issue. Our concern is for the buildings, many of them listed, in their setting in the countryside, and for maintaining the harmony of materials, design and scale which form the overall character of each place. There must be care for detail – shop fronts and signs, window-frames and doors as well as street furniture which fit the local scene and add to, rather than detract from its harmony.Unlike national bodies and regional authorities, which have wider responsibilities, ASHTAV, through the lo cal societies, groups and councils which are our members, possesses a wealth of local knowledge and commit ment. Our members, working together with other like-minded organisations are well placed to care for the vast wealth of architecture, history and community life which surrounds them.We concentrate on the particular needs and concerns of small historic places. We co-ordinate and encourage mutual support amongst our members, facilitating the exchange of experience and expertise and providing opportunities through seminars and lectures for increasing knowledge of conservation issues and the planning process. We also provide a corporate national voice on matters of concern to our members generally.ASHTAV’s objectives are:ASHTAV recognises the many social and economic changes affecting town and village life – the growth of industry and tourism, the migration from large towns and cities to the countryside, the decline of traditional agriculture and demographic change. These changes inevitably alter the pattern of life in rural Britain. They cannot be resisted but they should be introduced with respect for existing patterns and values.New developments can take place with sensitive consultation and respect for the existing scene and community life. Our aim is to ensure that wherever change is thought to be necessary, those whom it most directly affects are equipped to take a full and effective part in the decisions involved.ASHTAV receives grants from English Heritage and other bodies, but is otherwise self supporting and relies on the commitment and voluntary effort of its members and Fiends.Join us to take full advantage of the services offered by ASHTAV and share your skills & experience with other ASHTAV members.Membership offers:A regular Newsletter full of information vital to historic places on planning and conservation issues.Seminars and training events in interesting places.Helpful advice from the ASHTAV ‘Help Desk’.The website giving members access to information exchange with each other.Access to members with experience in similar situations when you have a problem.Very good value.Formed in 1988 by Amenity Societies keen to pool their experience and share their expertise, the Associa tion offers members an advisory service, a programme of instructive seminars and a Newsletter covering the latest information about conservation and development. Membership is open to Town and Parish Councils and Amenity Societies in all historic villages and small historic towns. The Association also wel comes individuals as friends and District and County Councils as AssociatesWithin the United Kingdom there are many beautiful and charming small towns that provide the perfect location and backdrop for your wedding. With lush green hills, clear air, country cottages and charming architecture, small towns in Britain add character, elegance and a little bit of a rustic feel to every wedding. Here we’ve listed some of the most beautiful and charming small towns that would make perfect wedding venues.The capital cities of the world are mostly well known.

WrightMatch awarded to CassioburyO.Blackburn (4), D.WiniarskiAston U14s 5 - 0 Chorleywood Well its been 4 games in 12 days for the U14 colts who entertained Chorleywood at Weston this morning. Cracking day for football, full strength team so was looking forward to a really good game. They boys didnt start as sharp as they normally are, the passes were not coming off and we were giving Chorley more time on the ball and they seemed more up for it than us We seemed half asleep! but somehow Ollie managed to score and we got our noses in front.Team talk at half time was be a bit sharper, get passing, better tackling and work harder. Within minutes of the restart Harry Collins passed through to Ollie who scored his second then his third from a throw in from speedy Reidy. By this time we were all over Chorleywood and the goals kept coming. A corner from Harry Collins saw a header from Ollie in the top corner. Boom! Ollie's 4th and a few minutes later same corner from Harry saw Dawid score with a bullet header. Job done the second half was superb boys, the football was great and the goals awesome, so well done? Thanks to speedy Reidy for going in goal for Jack.... 8th clean sheet!? MOM was Harry Moores, what a player you've become, the tackles, covering for your team mates and now showing great leadership qualities in the back 4 so well done you?Thanks to my usual crew and Dave for running the line. Also excellent job by our referee Sophie.We have a few Sunday's rest now, next match is Wednesday 9th of May (away)Training as normal on Saturday.Aston U14s 2 - 1 Berko Blue.Wow another squeaky bum time second half at Weston saw the U14 Colts get another win and more importantly 3points in the League. I was able to pick both Josh and Harry Collins for the first time for months so had a full strength team to take on local rivals Berko who were 3rd in table ?. The team talk was simple go out play with high tempo and passion and win the ball.The game was played in the blistering heat(nice to see the sun for once though) and the tempo in the first half was fast and furious with Berko taking an early lead. We got back in the game quickly with some great build up play from the midfielders especially Harry Collins who played into space for Josh to run on to & score twice. We could of had more goals but it wasn't to be, we need a bit more composure on the ball. Second half we hung on and dug deep and the passion from every player in a colts shirt was outstanding so be proud of yourselves. The team did what they needed to do,, the tackles passing and the goals were awesome. Jacks saves & kicks were fantastic ?MOM was Harry Collins for his assists and composure on the ball tonight well done?Thank you to the crew who helped out tonight ( Di, kelvin, Mark, Michelle, Dave & Andrew) Now off to bed ??Scorers: C.Hatcher (2), J.Johnston (4)Goal : J.HollingsworthScorers :Z.Harris, R.Pereira Correia, S.

We recovered to lead 5-1 at half time and the second half wasn't a contest as the Oxhey heads went down. Scorers were Matt KS (3), Mitchell (3), Alex (2), Chris Ball, Elliott, JP. OG & Jack Jenkins.

The Scottish Highlands, wild and rugged, have a timeless romantic quality. At their very heart, where the River Tummel flows to the Tay, sits the historic small town of Pitlochry. The Atholl Palace Hotel, the epitome of Scottish Baronial splendour, stands overlooking wooded parkland grounds and the town to the surrounding hills. Originally opened as the Athole Hydropathic in Victorian times, the hotel retains many features of the traditional large country house, with bedroom facilities and standards which often exceed expectations and complement spacious, relaxing public areas.The Atholl Palace is now so much more than a hotel - it is a destination for day visitors as well as guests. You can easily spend a day exploring the gardens, discovering our museum and enjoying a bar lunch or afternoon tea in the lounge, not to mention being pampered in the Spa. We hope you enjoy the Atholl Palace, we want to make sure you’ll come back, again and again!" 16851.0 0.0 "Pitlochry Hotels | Highland Hotel | Scottish Castle | Atholl Palace"

// End -->Atlas Language School has been established for over ten years
      With an experienced team of selected EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teachers, Atlas is launching an exciting new Summer School in Devon which aims at the highest standards of tuition, accommodation and social activities for students aged from 12 to 17 years old in 2009 for all language courses and language lessons

      Our aim is to give all students the best possible opportunity to improve their English language skills over their two week stay with us. We believe that this can be achieved in an enjoyable way, through sharing lessons together, taking part in a social programme and staying with carefully selected English host families. The courses are also multinational in order to give the students even greater opportunity to practise speaking English.

      There will normally be a maximum of 10 students in each class. The low class sizes will enable the teachers to concentrate on the needs of the individual, who will benefit from the increased care and attention.

      These same teachers will accompany the students throughout all the activities in the social programme. This will give the students ample opportunity to get to know their teachers in a relaxed environment. We can also guarantee every student the opportunity to visit London on the middle Saturday of their course.

      All students will stay with friendly host families in London. We will always do our best to match our students with an appropriate family who have children of a similar age. The families will always involve their student in any activity that they would normally undertake themselves.

      We have made every effort to create a holiday that will help students to enjoy their improvement and improve their enjoyment. We hope to see you this summer 2015The Association of British Language SchoolsAtlas Language School Language Courses for all London Battersea SW11

Odd titbits of motoring and militaryOdd titbits of motoring and militaryPlease note: this site has no connection with the Austin Champ
Owners Club (ACOC). I was asked to give CN
to the ACOC when the Northern
Champ Group changed its name to the ACOC but I would not
because the ACOC has:
- no Constitution
- no elections
- no accounts
- nowhere does it state in the 'club' magazine that the 'club' is incorporated. 'Incorporation' means to form a limited liability company. In this litigious age, if a club is not incorportated 
and, say, holds a road run or a show and there is an accident then the individual members could be held joint and severally liable, which, in effect, means the lawyers go for whichever individual member has the easiest money to get at, and that could be millions, it could be you if you are a member of the ACOC. Being incorportated also makes it easier to get insurance, is the 'club' insured?
   If any of the above is wrong please contact me. Update Dec. 2017: it seems that the ACOC now has insurance but it is up to prospective members to check.

The Pilchard Works produces two different MSC certified sardine tins using traditional manufacturing techniques to bring out the wonderful taste of sustainable Cornish sardine stocks. From the moment of capture to the point where fish are processed by the cannery in Douarnenez, Brittany, every effort is made to get the best from the locally caught fish and the labours of the fishermen that catch them.Ever wonder what the difference is between a sardine and a pilchard? Nothing. Both are Sardina Pilchardus, but the smaller fish tend to be called sardines and those over 15cm long called pilchards.The Pilchard Works makes two varieties of sustainable sardine tins. High in Omega-3 oils and protein, our traditionally made tins are both tasty and healthy. Many people eat them right out of the tin or on toast as a quick snack.Caught off the shores of Cornwall by small boats fishing for a few hours at a time, the fish are landed while as fresh as possible. Hauls are often caught within sight of Newlyn in Mount’s Bay. Sometimes a shoal is found so close to the harbour that people can watch the boats at work from the harbour quays, or you can usually see their lights flashing a little further out in the bay. The fish are only taken from the boats when in their best condition – a question of oil content in relation to the body weight of the fish.At the cannery in Brittany the fish are hand sorted before the canning process begins. The fish are filleted and then flash-fried according to a process that has been developed and used since 1853 when our canners, the oldest sardine cannery in the world came into being. The tins are individually filled by hand before the sauce or marinade is added. The canning process uses a combination of the latest in processing equipment with the most traditional of methods to capture the best flavours. Finally, the tins are checked for content and quality by hand before being sealed.The recipes used in our tinned fish products have been created exclusively for The Pilchard Works.  Whether preserved in extra virgin olive oil or rich tomato sauce, the flavour of the fish bursts through.Cornish sardines – or pilchards, which are just big sardines by another name – caught with traditional small nets by day boats, are my top choice (The Pilchard Works brand is my favourite) The Guardian – Tinned Fish RecipesThe Pilchard Works prides itself on staying true to traditional techniques, hand-grading, flash-frying and hand-filling its beautiful tins – as was the way with the first sardine cannery, back in 1853. These are delicious: a world away from those haunting memories of childhood teas.I know few chefs who could resist a tin of decent sardines, simply mashed onto hot toast. My favourites are from The Pilchard WorksThe tinned pilchards from The Pilchard Works in Cornwall are … good, sweet and succulent and so fine I just eat them straight out of the tin.At the Pilchard Works we manufacture and wholesale two different types of MSC certified Cornish Sardine / Pilchard fillet tins. Made in partnership with Britain’s oldest pilchard processors and Brittany’s oldest sardine cannery, we offer mature Cornish Sardines, canned in a traditional way to ensure the best possible taste. Our tins are decorated with Newlyn School paintings by Walter Langley and Frank Bramley.We use Amazon to allow you to easily purchase 14 tins in a tray direct from us. The tray becomes the presentation display, ready to put on a shop shelf and show off the Newlyn School paintings on the front of the tins.

For over 450 years “Salacche Inglesi” – Cornish salt pilchards – was exported from Cornwall to Italy. As a mainly Catholic country with a necessity to eat fish on Friday, the humble salt pilchard filled the requirement without refrigeration.In 1982 Nick Howell purchased British Cured Pilchards Ltd and still runs the business today. Traditional salt production continued in exactly the same way. In 1995 EU regulations saw The Pilchard Works capitalise on its traditions by opening as a working museum. We told the story of pilchard fishing and processing in Cornwall with visitors able to soak in the smells, sights and noise of the working salt pilchard pressing room. For 10 years we enjoyed greeting people from all over the world and even had two Royal visits from HRH Prince Charles and HRH Prince Andrew.The Pilchard Works was the last remaining Cornish salt pilchard factory. It ceased salted fish production in 2005, but continues to make and sell three types of traditional, unsalted Cornish pilchard fillet tins. Our unique combination of the best Cornish fish and canning techniques perfected since 1853 ensure a wonderful taste.Available individually from Waitrose and many delicatessens around the country, or in any quantity through our own Amazon store and from our wholesalers.Name *E-Mail *Subject *Message *British Cured Pilchards Ltd

The cultural town of Corsham is located in Wiltshire, England and is famed for its historical buildings and traditional village style. The civil parish town is made distinctive by its peacocks which roam the streets freely. Its locally sourced limestone makes up many of the buildings in the town which are a mix of 16th, 17th and 18th century properties.The town owes most of its economy to the wool trade as well as the quarrying of golden Bath stone (commonly known as limestone) for local use in the buildings. It was discovered in droves when the Box tunnel was built for the Great Western Railway meaning it could be quarried and sold to other towns all over England.The town’s history is owed to its people and several family names from centuries back are still seen in the town today. In particular, the Methuen family still reside in Corsham Court.The town recently went back to its roots with the re-launch of its local bustling market which can be seen in the high street once every Tuesday. The cultural town of Corsham has also been the location for many films, television and photo shoots including the Harry Potter films and many period dramas. Its diverse architecture and beautiful scenery make it the ideal place for stunning visuals.The most notable landmark in the town is Corsham Court. This stately home is still one of the most stunning buildings to see in the town and is based on a 1582 Elizabethan design. It has housed eight generations of Methuens and is currently home to James Methuen-Campbell. This estate is where the roaming peacocks originate from.There are several old buildings which are major tourist attractions. The 17th century Schoolroom and Almshouses are filled with their original Victorian furnishings and the building itself still stands exactly as it was when it was built. St. Bartholomew’s Church is one of the oldest relics that still remains, being constructed in the 12th century. This is just an example of some of the main buildings of interest but the high street itself is full of listed buildings, some being hotels and bed and breakfasts.Limestone is the predominant material used in the buildings of Corsham as it has been readily available since Roman times. Many of the buildings still standing along the high street of Corsham were built in the 1800’s when the Bath stone was first discovered in the quarries.The quarrying of limestone from north to south allows for the varying colours of the stone seen in the buildings, some with golden hues, some more creamy. There are buildings of Georgian, Victorian and Elizabethan design, with traditional softwood sash windows and period fixtures. The buildings are like ancient relics, standing for centuries and most old designs are listed buildings meaning they cannot be altered from their original beauty. This all adds to the village’s charm however, and makes the town a historical exhibit in itself.Send Your FeedbackYour PrivacyArchitecture and BuildingsCorsham HeritageCorsham HistoryCorsham HolidaysCorsham Shopping & MarketsCorsham and Wiltshire CountrysideWhat's on in Corsham© 2011 Corsham Town, all content copyright.

Encompassing some of England’s best known towns like Manchester and Liverpool, Lancashire was established in the 12th century when its boundaries were finally defined. Lancashire would become one of the biggest textile manufacturing centers during the industrial revolution. Located in North-West England, Lancashire was once known as the County Palatine of Lancaster and it has a population of almost 1,500 000 inhabitants on an area of 3.080 km2.In the 19th century, when the industrial revolution gained momentum, Lancashire was one of the first towns in England to significantly profit from the back-then modern industrial machinery. England engaged in cotton textile production in mid-18th century, and Lancashire was one of the centers where it was made along with its neighbouring counties. First, the production was powered by water wheels, and Lancashire was abundant in water with its many rivers which created the ideal conditions for water-powered cotton mills. Lancashire had also an adequate work force, and the ideal climate conditions which would eventually lead to the growth of the cotton empire in the county.After the Father of the Industrial Revolution, Richard Arkwright – an entrepreneur, businessman and factory owner, introduced the first steam textile mill in Manchester, manufacturing came to a milestone. The first steam-driven textile machinery was not successful and effective at first, but it laid the foundations for machinery usage in the textile industry which would lead to mass production centers all over England and especially in the cotton-cradle Lancashire. Lancashire was about to say goodbye to the romantic farmer life, to its fresh and clean air, since the modern industrial way of life was taking over the whole county. Manchester and other Lancashire towns became the most popular cotton textile centers in the world with an astonishing 32% cotton production on a global level in 1871. From the 1850s, cotton mills were opened in suburban parts of the cities and also in the neighbouring countries, leaving space for other sectors to expand in the cities. Manchester, for example, as well as other cities, became commercial centers with banks, warehouses, and other services which were at the disposal to the surrounding cotton towns.The suburban parts, also known as hinterlands, where the cotton and textile factories were moved, were called Cottonpolis. There were more than 200 cottonpolises in England in the 19th century. With the industrial revolution, life became faster and different transport networks were part of the whole system facilitating communication between distant areas. The Manchester-Liverpool railway, opened in 1830, was the first railway to run exclusively on steam power connecting the Manchester and Liverpool cottonpolises or hinterlands with the city directly representing a true symbol of progress back then.Manchester made a shift from the biggest cotton center to the biggest warehouse center. The magnificent Manchester buildings that were erected during the industrial revolution preserved their beauty even today and stand proudly as a reminder of the great industrial times.The industrial revolution, despite its many benefits, like setting the path of modern life, was not ideal for factory workers. Business owners and entrepreneurs were the ones who enjoyed prosperity and the industrial life, a way of life, carried out on the bear shoulders of regular workers. The industrial revolution accounted for organized work, discipline, a working schedule, and many other things that we as a society kept until today. But, in the wake of the revolution, workers were not protected by laws, and some would even say, that they basically were the factory owners’ property. Factory workers had to work day and night for miserable pay checks in hazardous conditions with no safety guarantee until the establishment of the first Trade Unions which were also born in the 19th century with the purpose to stop worker abuse.When it comes to the environment, the industrial revolution was marked by pollution, filthy air, smog, and the towns soon became grey under the heavy clouds of smog. Manchester was especially known for fog, polluted air, and industrial waste, and it was often labelled as the city of greed, constant work, and profit with its large industrial chimneys that seemed to never sleep.Since the cotton and textile factories in Lancashire worked with full force not knowing any limits, it came to a stop as a result of overproduction in a time when world markets were shrinking. The Cotton Famine was also called the Cotton Panic and kept the Lancashire citizens in suspense for four years (1861-1865). These were the years of the American Civil War which also took its toll on the British factories which traded across the Atlantic on the American market and relied heavily on American imports. The preceding years resulted in over-production which also led to a drop in price and value. Demand for raw cotton which had been imported form the USA, also dropped since the cotton prices went up due to frequent blockades and rare import opportunities due to warfare. The paradox of low textile prices in Britain and high raw cotton prices in America led to difficult times in Lancashire.The consequences were heavy for the workers and citizens of Lancashire since many of them lost their jobs due to bad textile market conditions, and Lancashire, once the industrial leading and most prosperous county, had become one of the most impoverished regions in England. The depression caused a true stand-still in the cities of Lancashire and many public programs were introduced to create new jobs since the majority of the population had to rely on soup kitchens and direct aid. Relief committees were formed to support the former factory workers and the towns in general. After the Cotton Famine, in 1864, cotton production and imports were restored, but by then, many towns had taken on new forms and many people had had emigrated.With a rich and abundant history, Lancashire developed into one of the major tourism centers. Manchester is one of the most visited towns by tourist from all around the world. The city of Blackpool has evolved into a major tourism destinations as well, located on the North-West coast of England. Tourism in Lancashire developed after the 19th century railroad construction that linked the major cities of Lancashire opening the door to travel. Blackpool became the favorite English resort for holidaymakers by the 20th century, not only for the British who rush to Blackpool to recharge their batteries, but also for Americans, Germans, French, and others.For Reservation Call : 1.888.222.5847Search Anything Which You Desire.OUR 'Questions' feature has proved too successful for its own good.

We now have one our most popular bite-sized courses, the Creativity Kickstart on DVD. Without an introduction, using creativity techniques can seem strange and unnatural. This 1 hour DVD is the perfect introduction to familiarise yourself with business creativity, to be able to make practical use of creativity techniques. Click here to read more.Alternatively, we can provide a PowerPoint for our popular Creativity Kickstart course along with a full trainer’s guide. Click here to read more.Time for training is increasingly tight. It takes real dedication to take a whole day off work. These sessions, lasting one to two hours, are designed to fit around the working day as breakfast or lunchtime events, or to take up a manageably small chunk of working time. We have been running these bite size events since 1995 and they continue to be amongst our most popular (and cost effective) sessions. Most can run with any size audience. Bite size sessions cost £800 each, or are available for small groups at our individual rate of £125/head (minimum 3 attendees). Like all our sessions, pricing assumes you will provide the facilities and excludes VAT, books and travel expenses.This 1.5 hour seminar introduces the basics of creativity in an informal, interactive session. The participants get the chance to try out two powerful techniques and there is significant audience participation throughout. Suitable for groups of any size (maximum so far 800), the session is the ideal introduction to practical business creativity. Creativity and innovation are not optional extras. In a challenging environment, creativity is a survival skill. It’s not enough to do what you’ve always done because the world is changing around you. The Creativity Kickstart event gives a powerful introduction to the nature of creativity, the need for it and the mechanisms available to enhance creativity in a practical, day-to-day manner. Experience has shown that the requirement to do something about creativity is only really understood once individuals have some experience of the approach and techniques available – the Kickstart is designed to give that initial boost. OutlineIntroduction – who the speaker is, why we are here, warm-up exercise exploring assumptionsWhy bother? – A brief exploration of why there is a need for creativity, driven by the participants own ideas.Can anything be done? – Moving from random brainstorming to systematic approaches. The five key features: culture, techniques, environment, personal development and fun.Blocking creativity – We are all very good at blocking creativity, suppressing our own ideas and putting down other people’s. By getting an understanding of the techniques we use to block creativity, we can prevent this happening in the future.Working in a framework – All too often ideas can be generated that either aren’t a good match to the requirement, or that aren’t then carried through to implementation. We look briefly at a four stage framework to ensure that thinking doesn’t stay blue sky.Sample technique 1 – We use a very reliable idea generation technique (Random Picture) on a generic problem to gain some experience of creativity techniques. It is important this first sample doesn’t use a real problem from the organization, as that can lead to focus on the problem, not the approach.Sample technique 2 – We use a very different technique (The Takeover) to see how varying techniques can be used and produced differing solutions. This example can be used on a real business problem or a generic.Doing something – we finish by encouraging attendees to take this further. Creativity requires practical experience. The more it’s practised, the easier it becomes.Click to download a detailed session information sheet.We have a range of workshops available:Kickstart Phase II - A second stage session that builds on the Creativity Kickstart to reinforce its value in your organizationCreative Design - Whatever the application, creativity can makes use of the principles of good design to enhance ideas.Creative Teams - Exploring ways to improve team working and to enhance problem solving and idea generation in groups.The Creative Agenda - It’s no use giving staff the tools to be creative if your organization doesn’t support creativity.Creative Customer Service - There are few aspects of an organization that can benefit more from creativity than customer service.Sometimes you need to become immersed in a subject. Our full day sessions are aimed at those who will benefit most from the expertise, or who will act as ambassadors to spread the word. Most run with 10 to 20 people – that’s still as little as £100 each for a day’s training. Full day sessions cost £2,000 per day or are available for small groups at our individual rate of £295/head (minimum 3 attendees). Like all our sessions, pricing assumes you will provide the facilities and excludes VAT, books and travel expenses. To keep costs down you could omit giving a book to attendees, but we strongly recommend it as a very effective way to sustain the message back into the workplace.One of the most popular sessions, the creativity day is long enough to allow the participants to get a good immersion in creativity techniques. There are two main variants of the creativity day. Each is very interactive and participative, but variant A gives attendees the widest toolkit of techniques to go away ready to use, including several quick exercises helpful for improving team working, while variant B gives the participants a whole group afternoon to attack a single problem using a more detailed approach. In variant A, the first half of the day combines an interactive learning exercise - an expanded form of the taster that gives more information on creativity – with an opportunity to take a single problem through the four stage creative process in small groups. The second half of the day builds a toolkit of techniques to go away and use, finishing with a personal agenda, pulling together the techniques as they are most likely to be used. Variant B goes into even more detail in the morning, with a few sample techniques to gain experience. In the afternoon, variant B addresses one or more real problems provided by the client, using a full framework of techniques, taking the participants in small groups through each of the stages of Imagination Engineering. In both cases, participants will be able to take what they have learned and apply it to future problems and idea generation requirements.

Brian has given a number of Guardian Masterclasses on science writing and gives writing workshops for business and organisations as part of Writing Project.Our tailored writing workshops develop writing skills and stimulate confidence at work. A workshop can last from 1.5 hours to a full day, or longer. This list of workshops is not exhaustive and we'll be happy to create a workshop especially for you.You’ll come away with a new approach to writing and the confidence to write effectively. Communicating scienceIdeal for any organisations in the science field, using Brian's extensive experience of science writing, can be focused on either writing for the public or writing the ideal academic paper.Who Are You Writing For?Knowing your audience is crucial. This workshop will help you communicate clearly and concisely to the people you want to influence. Participants will learn key writing and editing skills and boost their confidence in shaping their message for different clients/stakeholders.Use More Engaging LanguageThere's often too much jargon and over-used vocabulary in professional communications. This workshop will experiment with fresh language and explore the use of metaphor and simile. It aims to provide tools for more engaging phrase- making and find alternatives for tired and unimaginative phrases.Edit Yourself BetterSave management time by creating better first drafts. Using examples from your organisation, and others generated during the workshop, this session provides practical techniques for effective editing. Learn to re-structure, summarise, and make documents more accessible to your target audience. Experiment with editing your own and colleagues' writing.Understanding Your NarrativeNarratives define who we are and what we do. Organisations need stories that clearly depict what they represent, why they exist, and where they are going. This workshop will help you define your story and express it memorably. We will look at how to foreground your USP and other stand-out elements of your organisation within a coherent narrative that will engage your customers and stakeholders. Writing Press ReleasesSnappy, factual, story-driven: press releases must be all these things if they are to grab a journalist's attention and get your message across. This workshop focuses on how to identify your core message, craft punchy headlines, and construct press releases that the media will want to publish.Email EtiquetteCasual and friendly? Precise and official? Somewhere in between? This workshop discovers how to set the appropriate tone for your emails, both in-house and to other organisations. Explore the question of language register, how to establish authority and show tact in response – and learn how to self-edit before hitting 'send'.Blogging and Social MediaWho do you want to engage? What image do you want to project? How do you find your desired audience and communicate your message in a tone that will keep them on your side? Participants will experiment with different voices and tones to attract interest, and discover techniques for building a compelling online presence as well as keeping up the momentum.Writing Marketing DocumentsLearn how to fine-tune public documents to attract and win over your target readership. Based on your organisation's own marketing/PR materials, this workshop shows how to hone your style and tone to convey the optimum public image/brand identity.Note-taking TechniquesIt's easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of information you collect and collate. This workshop looks at ways to analyse information as you record it, and how to be strategic, concise and accurate in your note-taking. It also looks at selecting for relevance and priority in your notes, so that you can put what matters first.(Charity professionals) Bid Writing and Grant ProposalsIf you're seeking funding, this workshop will help you create powerful and effectivebids, proposals, and letters to potential donors. Written communication skills will be honed and polished through an understanding of the process, attention to structure, clarity of intention, and imaginative ways to engage different audiences.For further details on writing workshops and audits, email brian@brianclegg.net.CostsBite-sized 1.5 hour events cost £800, half day £1400 and full day £2000.

Travel expenses and VAT extra.Click on a talk to read more:Time travel makes for wonderful science fiction, but in this talk, we take a trip with science writer Brian Clegg into the real world of time machines. Surprisingly, there is nothing in the laws of physics that prevents us from travelling through time. In fact, time travel is a natural consequence of relativity - though the reality is very different from the time machines of fiction. There is no other topic that captures the imagination so dramatically. From an exploration of the nature of time and why time travellers’ conventions don’t get many attendees to the revelation of our best time machine that has already been built, this talk shatters our illusions on the reality of time travel. Hear a recording of the How to Build a Time Machine talk, given as part of the Bath University external lecture programme:Click here to play ->Your browser leaves much to be desired.Beginning by inventing our own number system based on goats, we explore the nature of mathematics - how it operates in its own world, and yet can have such a strong connection to our own. We see how apparently unreal concepts like imaginary numbers can have a huge input on practical science and engineering and ask if today's physicists are allowing mathematics to be too much in control. A rare opportunity to think about what maths actually is and what its impact has been.Quantum physics is fundamental to our understanding of the world around us. Everything from the atoms in your body to the photons in a beam of light are quantum particles, which act bizarrely by appearing to be in many places at the same time or passing through barriers as if they're not there. Not only is this the basis of all matter and light, now a huge amount of technology depends on it - a smartphone contains at least seven different quantum technologies - yet most of us know little about this amazing science and the remarkable stories of the development of quantum applications from lasers to superconductors.Based on Brian's book about the origins of the universe and what came before it, this talk gives the audience a chance to explore the most popular question asked of the British Science Association - what came before the Big Bang. The event starts with the creation myths and explores how we first began to realize the scale of the universe. From there we see how the Big Bang theory came into being and how it isn't quite as certain as it is often portrayed, looking at the best of the current alternative theories. As the title suggest, we also consider that perennial question, if there was a Big Bang, what came before it... and discover that the answer could be nothing at all.Data has been with us since we first made marks on clay tablets, but big data takes information technology - and its impact on our lives - to a whole new level. The combination of four key pieces of tech - the internet, advanced computers, smartphones and sophisticated algorithms that manage and interpret huge flows of data has made our systems worryingly powerful. In this engaging talk, Brian Clegg looks at how Netflix used big data to turn TV production on its head, why big data encourages airlines to overbook and how it enables unnervingly personal adverts to appear on our computers. Big data presents us with a huge opportunities… and challenges. It can make our lives better, from improvements in medical diagnosis to the benefits of a smart home, or it can ruin our lives where jobs are managed by algorithms and our finances are managed with no way of understanding how the decisions are made or appealing against them. Big data is here to stay - so we all need to understand it better.An enjoyable exploration of the science that you will experience on a plane journey, both in the flight itself and also in the view from your airplane window. From Newton’s laws to relativity, from fractals to cloud formation, there’s something fascinating every moment. Do you know why you can’t make a good cup of tea on a plane? Or that sat nav would be wrong by several kilometres in one day if they didn’t allow for relativity? All will be revealed.Based on Brian's book The First Scientist and a debate he devised for the Royal Institution, this is an exploration of what science is. The talk hangs on key people who might be considered to be the first scientist - people like Archimedes, Roger Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo and even Maxwell. But apart from giving some entertaining insights into these key characters in the development of science it's also an opportunity to explore the nature of science and why we do it. Optionally we can have a vote at the end to see who the audience believe was the first scientist.Most of us struggle with memory. But in this fun, interactive talk with plenty of activities, there's a chance to learn a little about how memory works and try out some practical techniques that will help you remember people's names, numbers and lists of information. It's a talk you can't fail to remember.Linked to Brian's book Ecologic, this talk/discussion looks at how our attitude to green issues from recycling and carbon footprints to Fairtrade and organic food tend to be influenced more by emotion than by logic. The talk provides students with a toolkit to take a more realistic, less black-and-white view of the environment.Where did the idea of infinity come from? Who were the people who defined and refined this paradoxical quantity? Why is infinity, a concept we can never experience or truly grasp, at the heart of science? How can some infinities be bigger than others? An exploration of the most mind-boggling feature of maths and physics, this talk examines amazing paradoxes and the people who devised and refined the concept.This fascinating exploration of probability, statistics and randomness explains how chaos and randomness are often behind the realities of everyday life. We learn how to toss a head ten times in a row, how to make predictions with impossible accuracy, why people volunteer to give up thousands of pounds for no good reason, and a recreate a game show that left the woman with the world's highest IQ being reviled by a whole list of academics... until they discovered she was right. The video below is of my Dice World talk at The John Rylands Library as part of the Manchester Science Festival, courtesy of the Royal Society.Once, we sought absolutes, certainties, and facts to explain the world around us. But as science has developed, relativity has swept away many of those certainties, leaving only a handful of unchangeable essentials: absolute zero, nothingness, and light. As a result, is science better now and is it taking us closer to the essence of being human? By building a universe from scratch, we see the importance of relativity and frames of reference. From the essentials of space, stuff and time through life and human creativity, this exploration of relativity establishes humanity's place in the universe.Let go of something - it falls. Of course it does. But why? Starting with this question we explore the weakest of the four forces of nature, yet the one that is responsible for the formation of stars and planets and the existence of life. What did people used to think gravity was? Why did Newton's contemporaries laugh at his ideas? How does general relativity explain that an apple falls because of a warp in time? And is antigravity possible. A journey into this most fascinating and mind-bending force including an introduction to general relativity.Eadweard Muybridge was an eccentric Victorian photographer who produced the first high speed motion photographs, analysed the movement of animals and humans, devised the first motion picture projector and ran the first cinema. He travelled out from his birthplace of Kingston upon Thames to the wild world of 1870s California, where he murdered his wife's lover. It's a story packed with drama and fascinating technological developments.Creativity Unleashed provides the website and sales management services for www.hymncds.com - an organisation providing hymn and song accompaniments on CD and downloadable from iTunes and Amazon.

              a touch of magic and an injection of culture, then look no further. 
              Celtic music, like most forms of traditional roots music, is not

              as the best in their field in the South West. This is not just down 
              to experience and good musicianship...... everyone in the band loves 
              performing to live audiences, and gets a real buzz from the spontaneity 
              that this infuses into the music.“Thank 
              you for the fantastic music you played for our wedding. We forgot 
              the rain
              and enjoyed dancing with all our friends and family. It will be

This Web-site is managed and maintained byAfter many years entertaining audiences in the Social Clubs and Pubs, producing his type of country music, Dave became accepted as a supporting solo act in the Country Music Clubs, supporting such top names as Raymond Froggatt. Dave produces his own particular vocal originality.His big break came working at Lakeside Country Club in Camberley, Surrey, one of the UK's top venues. Glen Campbell, and Billie Jo Spears are such names that appeared at the club during this period. In 1991 he had the privilege to record at Sound Stage Studio, Music Circle, Nashville. Upon his return he embarked on a successful major theatre tour of the U.K.Dave still revels in live performing, writing and recording.Dave made many radio appearances on the B.B.C. World Service, British Forces Network, and his records have been given many an air play on BBC Radio 2 and local radio stations in the UK, Germany and America.One  of  the  country  music's  biggest  presenters,  David Allan  from Radio  2 Country Club,  has  quoted that  ""Dave  is one of the real originals of the British country scene with a style and sound very much of to-day.""“When people as important and knowledgeable as David Allan say this you tend to  sit up and take  notice"",  quote by  Stuart Cameron, Radio Caroline.Dave's  success on vinyl is due to him meeting up with a very talented lyric writer,  Nicky Nicholls, producing the music for her true life lyrics. Record sales have been good in the UK and Germany and as far away places as the Falkland Islands.Records to date are  ""Child of 1945"", a single produced in  1984, which gave Dave world-wide acclaim, especially in America, the heart of country music. On a compilation album entitled ""British Country Harvest"", produced on the White Rabbit label, Dave's track reached No. 2 for two weeks on the Radio Oxford country charts compiled by Stuart Cameron. This was a cover version of the Seekers song 'I'll Never Find Another You' and produced tremendous reaction by radio listeners.“Following on from this success, an LP was produced, the title track being 'Child Of  1945' and nine other original tracks, which provided a great show-case for not only the rich vocal tones of Dave but also the song writing prowess of Nicky Nicholls and Chris Andrews, Dave providing the musical score on half the lyrics”. Quoted by International Country Music News.He recently wrote and recorded a tribute song ‘A Man Named Johnny Cash’ which was the title track of his latest CD and received wide acclaim from it's numerous air-plays not only in the U.K. but also from around the world including Australia, Holland, France, Germany, Italy, Eire, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.He is currently writing his auto biography and is hoping to have it completed in the near future.You can find more information about Dave’s current CD releases by clicking on the links below.To email Dave, or for more information, please click hereHear Stuart Cameron’s Hot Country News Every Friday Night at 9pm and His Country Music Show Every Monday at 6pm on...Listen to Dave’s hit track ‘A man named Johnny Cash’ by clicking on the CD case aboveTo see a video clip of Dave in concert click on the image aboveListen to the award winning track ‘A Man Named Johnny Cash’ by clicking on the album cover aboveListen to Dave’s hit track ‘Everything I need in a woman’ by clicking on the CD case aboveTo listen to Dave on Spotify, please click on the link aboveHEAR COUNTRYTIME WITH HARRYEvery Sunday  between 3pm to 5pm UK time, click on the link below:www.radio-schlager-freunde.de" 38989.0 0.0 "Dave Vernon"

Davida  - Highest Quality, Luxury Open Face Motorcycle Helmets Made In England, UKAt Davida we have been defining quality in our own way for more than thirty years. It has been a genuine and relentless pursuit rewarded by a worldwide reputation for the quietest, most comfortable, and well made open face motorcycle helmets available.The results are some true classics, ( a must for any long distance ride) aesthetically very pleasing, beautifully put together and highly effective in their primary function of protection.Our philosophy at Davida stems from years of riding bikes. We have always understood, from experience, the importance of good kit when you're on the road. Whether being bold in the city or staying comfortable on challenging rides, certain things should not be compromised.That is why our open face helmets have always used the highest quality leather linings and why we have invested so much time developing designs that ensure a good fit. Modelled around the size and shape of the head, the overall size of the helmet is proportional to your head size- a smaller shell for smaller heads and visa versa.These helmets have always looked ""right"". yes, they are evocative of the past, but they are fresh as well. When it comes to the crucial function of a helmet safety, Davida have satisfied many of the Worlds strictest standards, achieving ECE-R2205 certification, ACU Gold in the UK as well as certifications for the USA, Scandinavia and Japan. Based on the Wirral, England, Davida are now the sole UK manufacturers of open face motorcycle helmets. We are proud that, unlike most modern creations, these open face motorcycle helmets are still hand-built in England using the best quality materials available. Every distinctive livery and detail is carefully created by individuals who still care about these things.We have also selected a collection of the best goggles available from around the world, all of which have been road tested by us to ensure that they fit well and work effectively with our helmets.Times have changed and the company is constantly evolving yet our helmets seem to look right whatever the decade.David Fiddaman - Fid the LidView & Download the Davida UK Ltd Catalogue herePlease see the full list of 2018 shows and events where you can try Davida ProductsGoggles, Visors & PeaksAviator Retro Pilot T1 Goggles - Black LeatherAviator Retro Pilot T2 Optical Goggles - Black LeatherAviator Retro Pilot T2 Optical Goggles - Brown LeatherAviator Retro Pilot T2 Optical Goggles - White LeatherAviator Retro Pilot T3 Goggles - Black LeatherAviator Retro Pilot T Series Replacement LensAviator Retro Pilot T Series Replacement HeadbandAviator Retro Pilot Replacement Lens FramesAviator Retro Pilot Replacement Frame ScrewAviator Retro Special Goggle - Black Foam RubberTo contact Davida directly please click here  or contact us through one of social channels below:" 39024.0 0.0 "

Welcome to my site. 

			I've 
			established it to keep in touch and you can always 
			reach me here.I was born in Ffestiniog, North Wales, 
			brought up in Hull and educated at Hull Grammar School before going 
			on to study modern history at St Catherine’s College, Oxford.

			I’m drawn to the creative tension between form and content so mostly 
			write in rhyme and metre. There are various poetry forms in this 
			book: sonnet, triolet, roundel, ballad, double dactyl, villanelle, 
			hymnal stanza and limerick, along with some of my own creation and a 
			few Japanese tanka.

			My life’s been spent in the near aura of famous poets: Dafydd ap 
			Gwilym, greatest of the Welsh bards; Philip Larkin, one-time 
			librarian of Hull University; Andrew Marvell, a fellow-alumnus of 
			Hull Grammar School.  I now live with my wife in Stoke Poges, 
			Buckinghamshire, a stone’s throw from the churchyard where Thomas 
			Gray is buried; still hoping that one day something of these poets 
			will rub off on me.

			I work as chairman of a financial services company and as a 
			councillor on South Bucks District Council.Up |

                        give seven day Notice of Enforcement to the tenant before taking further

INTEREST RATE HEDGING 
PRODUCTS: Insurance 
may have been mis-sold to some small to medium size business to protect for 
interest rate increases. The FCA have covered this in detail. See 
http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/financial-services-products/banking/interest-rate-hedging-products  For 
info sheet email adv@debtwise.co.uk

CARD PROTECTION POLICIES:
Card protection insurance has possibly been mis-sold. If you took out a 
policy through a CPP policy then it would appear the company will be writing to 
you. See The Financial Conduct Authority website

http://www.fca.org.uk/news/consumer-redress-agreed-for-mis-sold-cpp-insurance 
.  Do not use a claim company without considering alternatives. 
Complain to the card company, ask for details of their complaints policy, keep 
copies of all letters and if no progress consult with Financial Ombudsman 
Service. See

http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/payment-protection-insurance 
CLAIM MANAGEMENT COMPANIES 
: If an individual wishes to use a claim management company (which normally 
gives free advice but will charge for success in any claim) please ensure any claim 
handling company is regulated by the Ministry of Justice at
www.claimsregulation.gov.uk . 
The Ministry of Justice have guidance on how consumers should complain

http://www.justice.gov.uk/claims-regulation/information-for-consumers/how-to-complain  It is not recommended that claim management 
companies are used for PPI claims as there is sufficient online guidance to make 
a claim without cost.
CONSUMER CREDIT ACT 
AGREEMENTS : There is a lot of forum comment regarding possible 
unenforceability of CCA Agreements and Claim Companies offer to look at an 
Agreement (normally for a fee). There is ongoing legal work 
concerning the validity of CCA Agreements where a lump sum has been added up 
front or incorrect interest has been quoted. Debtwise strongly recommends that 
great care be taken before paying a fee for a CCA Agreement to be 'checked'. If 
anyone has any views please feel free to email
adv@debtwise.co.uk in order that 
information can be shared. See above regarding changes from 1 October 2015 in

INTEREST RATE HEDGING 
PRODUCTS: Insurance 
may have been mis-sold to some small to medium size business to protect for 
interest rate increases. The FCA have covered this in detail. See 
http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/financial-services-products/banking/interest-rate-hedging-products  For 
info sheet email adv@debtwise.co.uk

CARD PROTECTION POLICIES:
Card protection insurance has possibly been mis-sold. If you took out a 
policy through a CPP policy then it would appear the company will be writing to 
you. See The Financial Conduct Authority website

http://www.fca.org.uk/news/consumer-redress-agreed-for-mis-sold-cpp-insurance 
.  Do not use a claim company without considering alternatives. 
Complain to the card company, ask for details of their complaints policy, keep 
copies of all letters and if no progress consult with Financial Ombudsman 
Service. See

http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/payment-protection-insurance 
CLAIM MANAGEMENT COMPANIES 
: If an individual wishes to use a claim management company (which normally 
gives free advice but will charge for success in any claim) please ensure any claim 
handling company is regulated by the Ministry of Justice at
www.claimsregulation.gov.uk . 
The Ministry of Justice have guidance on how consumers should complain

http://www.justice.gov.uk/claims-regulation/information-for-consumers/how-to-complain  It is not recommended that claim management 
companies are used for PPI claims as there is sufficient online guidance to make 
a claim without cost.
CONSUMER CREDIT ACT 
AGREEMENTS : There is a lot of forum comment regarding possible 
unenforceability of CCA Agreements and Claim Companies offer to look at an 
Agreement (normally for a fee). There is ongoing legal work 
concerning the validity of CCA Agreements where a lump sum has been added up 
front or incorrect interest has been quoted. Debtwise strongly recommends that 
great care be taken before paying a fee for a CCA Agreement to be 'checked'. If

Hope you’re enjoying the holidays. Who said all the fun was over by the end of the 25th? Pre-orders for THE LAST BIG THING are now open. Head over to www.infectedbooks.co.uk.The book will ship by 8 January (if not sooner), and all pre-orders will be personally signed. I’d definitely recommend the print version – you’ll be able to fully appreciate the brilliant, easter-egg filled cover art by Craig Paton. As with all Infected Books titles purchased directly through the Infected Books website, you’re able to download and read the ebook version immediately once your order has been placed.And just to tempt you a little bit more… three lucky pre-orders placed before 8 January will also receive an advance copy of ALL ROADS END HERE. Here I go again spreading more Christmas and New Year cheer (actually, it’s more like New Year gloom – ALL ROADS is a heck of a brutal book).THE LAST BIG THING is officially released on 8 January, and will be available from all the usual places. Ebook versions will also be available from most retailers – at the time of writing this post, only Amazon is live.We sit in our own little bubbles, watching the rest of the world go by. We think ‘it’ll never happen to me’ but guess what? At some point it probably will. We might think we’re in control but believe me, there’s a lot we don’t know.In the spirit of The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected, cult author David Moody presents eleven stories about life, death and everything in between (and after).From the never-ending nightmare of domestic bliss to the search for the ultimate body modification, from warring families to warring nations, from the last minutes before doomsday to the polluted shores of the post-post-apocalypse, THE LAST BIG THING highlights how thin the line between the ordinary and extraordinary can be.Rule of thumb: whenever I quote a deadline, add on at least a month. Slightly later than planned, but here’s the cover for THE LAST BIG THING – a collection featuring my favourite shorts of the last ten years or so (plus a few brand new ones). The book will be available as a hardback and ebook from 8 January.Pre-orders will open on Wednesday 26 December.Featuring the following stories:BIG MANTHE DEALTHE LUCKY ONESOSTRICHGRANDMA KELLYWE WERE SO YOUNG ONCE (new)NOLAN HIGGS IS OUT OF HIS DEPTHAWAY WITH THE FAIRIES (new)EVERYTHING AND NOTHING: a HATER story (first time in print)ALMOST FOREVERTHE LAST BIG THINGTime flies. It’s a year now since ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD BY MORNING – HATER book #4 (or The Final War book #1, depending on your perspective) – was released. I always harboured a sneaking suspicion that the book wouldn’t go down well with everyone and, well, I was right. Sales haven’t been as good as I’d hoped, and it’s my worst reviewed book on Goodreads. But lots of folks really like it. And I really like it. And it serves an important purpose.When I decided to write a second HATER trilogy, I always knew I’d have to go right back to the beginning and introduce new characters. I also knew the book would need to be very different to HATER to emphasise the shift in perspective between the two trilogies. More than being a (very) self-contained survival horror story, though, ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD BY MORNING laid the groundwork for the next two books in the series – ALL ROADS END HERE and CHOKEHOLD (both of which will be published in 2019). And you know what? I think you’re going to have a blast with the direction the rest of the story is going to take.ALL ROADS END HERE is a sequel to both ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD BY MORNING and HATER, and promotion will be kicking off in the new year. I’ll tell you lots more about the new book after Christmas, but if you’re nice and relaxed over the holiday period and you feel like a little hate-fuelled angst to go with your turkey and trimmings, why not re-read DOG BLOOD. Not wanting to give too much away, but you’re going to be meeting several familiar faces from the first HATER trilogy when ALL ROADS END HERE hits the shelves in February!The AUTUMN short story HOME has been translated into Russian and appears in this month’s issue of DARKER (Russia’s number 1 horror webzine). I also did an interview with the mag which you can find here.I’m looking forward to returning to the world of AUTUMN in the near future. It’s been five years since the release of AUTUMN: THE HUMAN CONDITION and in those years the zombie sub-genre has changed completely. No one was talking about zombies when the first  book hit the shelves in 2001, but now they’re everywhere!Not read the AUTUMN series? This gives me a great opportunity to point you in the direction of www.lastoftheliving.net which will give you all the information you need, along with more than 40 short stories, including HOME. Many of the stories were illustrated by some very talented folks. A gentleman by the name of Michael Dick provided several sketches for HOME, such as this:" 41413.0 0.0 "David Moody - author of AUTUMN and HATER | Author of the AUTUMN and HATER horror novels and groundbreaking independent publisher of apocalyptic horror"

There’s nothing that can really make the everyday person experience thisLast time, we talked about different forms and styles which have been birthed in the recent years. Today, we talkWhen you really think about it, our history has seen quite a journey for art. In today’s world, there haveArt is one of the more precious treasures that we can claim to have produced through the years and eonsWhen it comes to the topic of performance art or even theater as art, there are a lot of opinions thrown around. Today, we wanted to share ours: theater is culture personified.If you’re not quite convinced, we’ve got a few solid reasons to back up our claim. Here they are:Costumes come with their own brand of awesome. It takes a lot of skill and artistry to bring to life costumes that stay true to the era of the play or even to help emphasize the story. Costumes help to accentuate the culture of the people that being portrayed by the play.We see this in period plays like Phantom of the Opera or Jane Eyre. Who can look at the costumes there and say that it is not art?The set work that goes into theater is its own industry and rightly so. There is significant planning that goes into building a set that accompanies a theater play. There are lights to consider, backdrops, props, and a plethora of other things that can really drive inexperienced people crazy.There are plays like the Lion King that really bring to life the sights and sounds of Africa. That in itself is culture and art.The stories that people get to tell on stage is the very personification of performance art. It is through talented people like those that portray the characters in Blind Spot that you really get to enjoy the culmination of great writing.It isn’t just the sounds or the sights that you see. It is the emotions that you feel while watching a play that really allows you to immerse yourself in the art of it all.?If you’re not convinced with that, we don’t know how else you’ll see the art and culture of theater. What other reasons can you think of as to why theater personifies culture and art?When you are interested in art or practice it, things can seem a little difficult—especially when you’re up against your own mental blocks. If you happen to be interested in it, we take a look at a few things you can do to hone it.We share with you a few tips that we ourselves adhere to:The beauty about art is that it is a passion that may people share. Therefore, there are always other people who are vastly interested in trying to find ways in making it work or trying their hand in it. This has made it quite a trade for many people who have the skill and the interest in teaching others.If you are interested in art, taking up a class should help wonders. You can even try going to a painting café where you can indulge your love for good wine, good food, and art.This is something that we find difficult to follow sometimes. It can be quite disheartening to think that you do a lot of work but you never seem to get better. However, it is through constant practice—even when it’s hard—that you can hone your art and make it a lot better.If you are interested in art, you need to work through your struggles and keep practicing. It is only then that you can reach a breakthrough.All art is struggle and growth. In order to see what else you can change and improve on, you’ll need to get feedback. As much as it may hurt or demoralize you at times, it is still important to take the bad and turn it into your strength.If you are interested in art, you need to take feedback and make it work for you.Art is always going to be difficult to pursue. This is why it is so great. It takes a person of a different caliber to really see it through to the end. What do you guys do when you want to hone your art?For some, music and performance make a heady combination. There’s nothing that can really make the everyday person experience this than by joining a choir. Today, we wanted to explore some of the benefits of being part of a choir.Let’s get down to it!Being in a choir is more than just belting out a tune or two. It also requires movement and choreography and an insane amount of practice to get it right. These can make it a really good combination for an exercise.People really need to find ways to exercise their bodies so that they’re not as tired or unhealthy. Being in a choir provides that opportunity.When people experience stress, it can be really unhealthy to have it bottled up on the inside. In places where karaoke is huge, singing is a tool to really let loose and let stress go. Being in a choir can really help you sort out whatever feelings you’ve got tucked in there can leave your system whenever you sing.Choirs give you the chance to sing out whenever you can and as loud as you can. This is a pretty effective way to relax.Choirs are often comprised of some of the best sort of people that you can meet. People tend to say that when you meet new people, it’s a lot like slots or even scratch cards. You don’t really know what you’re getting until all is said and done. The thing is, choirs don’t usually work that way.We’ve found that choirs often have the consistently good people. The bad ones do not stay for long so you’re left with a pretty good community.Choirs combine the excellence of music and the artistry of performance. If there’s one in your area, maybe you should take the time to figure out if you can join it. There are several benefits to it (as we’ve explained) and many more you can discover on your own.Last time, we talked about different forms and styles which have been birthed in the recent years. Today, we talk about something that you may find yourself familiar with: music. Specifically, we wanted to talk about local bands.We believe that music is art and that it is important to support local bands in your area. Here are a few good reasons why:Those that perform their music do need to support themselves and their families. If you manage to support a group that makes it big in the industry, you are effectively bringing prestige to your town. This can significantly boost the local economy and this means good news for you.When you play online casino games, you’d be familiar with the game of Wheel of Fortune. If you want that wheel to be on the up, you’ll have to help make it that way.Music is life for many. It is at that moment when the lights are flashing, the thump of drums and other instruments are so loud and that you ebb and sway to the music that you really experience what the whole thing is about.If you support local bands, you are effectively taking part in live culture as it happens.If you like a good party, the local bands throw some pretty stellar ones. They often partner with local pubs so not only are you enjoying music but you’re experiencing the local scene as well. You get to party out to awesome music and even meet people that can teach you a thing or two about having a good time.These are just a few reasons why supporting a local band and their art is a pretty good thing. We hope that you take that into consideration the next time you see a post for a local band. We’d like to know what you think about this. Why do you think it’s important to support local bands?by redalien.From Visually.When you really think about it, our history has seen quite a journey for art. In today’s world, there have been a lot of different art forms and styles which have been birthed. So what you really think about it, what else is considered to be art now?We feel this is a pertinent question as there has been a lot of doubt thrown over the validity of certain art forms. Here are a few styles and forms that is generally accepted to be art now:Graffiti used to be something that wasn’t to be celebrated or proud of. In fact, it was a criminal offense and still remains to be one for a majority of places around the world. This, however, does not remove the fact that there have been quite significant pieces of graffiti that has be created in the past fifty to sixty years.There are great artists which at first remained anonymous (some still are) and taken a great risk to share their talent and art with us.The age of computers has dawned and it has dawned well. Now, art is no longer just restricted to the idea of chiseled stone or easels and charcoal. Instead, art has transcended and even bled into the digital world.Digital art is any art that has been created through the use of creative media technology. A majority of light installations fall under this category.What is art if not something to make use feel and live through? Performance art is something that was doubted as the public was not familiar or comfortable with other people putting themselves up in display over their craft.?Whenever artists create something new, it is a gamble that they take. They can either be dealt with a good hand that can win the pot like in Baccarat or find themselves out in the cold. What other styles are now generally considered to be art?Art is one of the more precious treasures that we can claim to have produced through the years and eons of our existence. When you want to go and experience it for yourself, which places are the best places to go to? This is a question that we wanted to answer for today.We’ve thought about it long and hard and these are the answers that we came up with:This is a general no-brainer. Museums have been built specifically for the purpose of curating, displaying, and celebrating art. Of course, you will have to consider the sort of museum that you are going to. There are museums that are solely dedicated for other things.If you want to really see art, you would be smart to visit the dedicated museums like The Met or the Louvre. There are a lot of smaller scale ones so you’ll want to check if you have one near you.Every place in the world has their version of a heritage home. There are those that can be found in the middle of cities and there are those that you will need to travel to in order to reach. Heritage homes are a culmination of a life or a family of a famous person or someone significant in the earlier years of a nation.These generally have priceless keepsakes that are on display and people knowledgeable about them to share the tales left behind.You would be surprised at how much art finds its way to casinos around the world. This is particularly true for the ones you find on the Vegas strip. Eager gamblers get to enjoy a round of poker or several rounds of other games that’s available.All the while, feasting their eyes on artistic treasures from around the globe!That’s it for us.

A New Approach to Earth HistoryAbout the origin of the Earth and the creatures that multiplied on it.We are born into the world as if from nowhere, souls protesting at our entry with all the strength of our perfect lungs, as we breathe in the air around us. But we cannot remember our birth, and as we pass into adulthood, we begin to ask questions about man’s and the world’s origin, only to find that man too has no memory of how he came to be.Existence is a mystery. Having more credulity than curiosity, many assume that the planet that is our home during our brief lives had a natural origin. But is it reasonable to attribute nature with its own creative power, even to the extent of producing things incomparably more complex than human intelligence and technology can engineer? Can human life really be reduced to atoms, contrary to our sense of being distinct from our bodies and the physical world beyond?In recent decades it has become difficult to ask these questions in an open-ended way. Scientific institutions, educational establishments and broadcasting media all permit but one view of reality: the world created itself. Any other view else is mere religion.But doubt persists in sidling in. We live from day to day knowing that life is something different from molecules. Life involves consciousness, something that plants, which also reproduce via DNA, do not have. Our experience of ourselves as conscious beings tells us that there is more to reality than can be accounted for by molecules, however complex their organisation.Life is inherently and irreducibly wonderful. What we have done in rejecting theistic explanations – in declaring that God was not “a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything” – is simply transfer the power of miracle from God to Nature, using scientific language to dress up a belief in natural magic. Not that creation in 6 days provides a straightforward answer. While the glory of the heavens, the majesty of the continents and oceans and the secret lives of the animals that share our world all appear to deny a natural explanation of their existence, they do not speak directly of creation, because nothing is as it was. Everything lies at the end of a long history. Creation cannot be read from the universe’s present appearance.Moreover, we cannot go back to the beginning because a cataclysm near the beginning destroyed the original land. We have become aware of this only in the last 40 years, as a result of discovering that the Earth’s oldest crust is missing. The impact craters which defaced the Moon just prior to the beginning of the rock record destroyed Earth’s earliest record. Asteroids, combined with torrential flooding, rendered the planet formless and barren.It is this primeval cataclysm that offers the key to understanding the fossil record. After the bombardment the planet was in geological flux. Species had to colonise new seas and lands, and to diversify as they met the challenges. Bacteria were the first organisms to appear, not because they were the simplest but because they were the most prolific, and everything else depended on them, not least for the continuing production of oxygen. Other organisms gained a foothold as land surfaces stabilised: mosses, lichens, low-lying wetland plants and forest-forming trees in ecological succession, joined by an equally diverse range of animals millipedes, insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, reptiles.Evolution has two meanings. The first is the well established fact that all species originate from other species; the second, the presumption that all species, from bacteria to human beings, are related to one another and originated aeons ago from self-organising chemicals. Conditioned to think about such things without thinking, we tend to confound the two. When new species originate, we think we are seeing evidence for the theory that life evolved from a prebiotic soup. In reality there is no such evidence, and documented examples of evolutionary change cannot be explained in Darwinian terms.Their evolution is as miraculous as the creation of the progenitors with which their history began. Nonetheless, many theists deny that such transformations could have happened because they seem too miraculous, while atheists invoke god-like natural selection in order to deny the miraculous. An argument from incredulity on the part of believers, an argument from credulity on the part of unbelievers!The more spectacular the transformation or prodigal the diversity, the more it becomes clear that such phenomena were not the work of chance but pre-programmed just as the single-generation metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly, or of an egg into an ostrich, is evidently pre-programmed. Evolution of this kind in no way implies the denial of an original creation. Survivors from the cataclysm were endowed with enormous potential to diversify because there were so few of them. They were endowed with the potential to adapt because they had to colonise a world that, beginning from total devastation, had to pass through multiple stages of ecological renewal.This is a quality site, honouring good scholarship and seeking to be a trustworthy voice amid a cacophony of voices speaking on the same topics.

MyselfWe are a Helplines Partnership member and are here to provide you with addiction information and advice for your or your loved one’s problems.MoreThe cost of rehab is determined on the type of treatment a person receives. We work with 100% CQC-regulated rehabs only, providing quality care and support.MoreOur experts and professional medical staff at the clinics care about the lifelong alochol-free life of our clients.MoreThe first step of addiction rehab is going through detox, the period of withdrawal where any remaining traces of drugs or alcohol are eliminated from a person’s body. The withdrawal symptoms experienced during detox are dependent upon the nature of their addiction itself. Alcohol detox is different from drug detox, and everyone experiences detox differently.Detox is an important part of addiction rehab, and is the first step towards lasting sobriety.  Knowing the different options available for drug and alcohol detox services is vital before choosing an addiction treatment centre. It is important to note that detox shouldn’t be considered a treatment for addiction, but instead the first step of a comprehensive treatment programme.There are several different options available for addiction rehab services.

Going to an addiction treatment centre ensures an individual’s addiction is treated at the fundamental levels necessary for sustained sobriety. When a person chooses to go to an addiction treatment centre, they are choosing one of the most effective ways to overcome their addiction and take back their life.Alcohol addiction affects millions of people worldwide. Anyone who has suffered from alcoholism or has helplessly watched a loved one destroy their lives through drinking, knows just how devastating alcohol addiction can be. Not only can quitting drinking feel impossible, but can cause serious physical and psychological health problems. As hard as it might be for some people to stop drinking, going to alcohol rehab can help tremendously when a person is ready to get the help they so desperately need.Alcohol rehab is for people who specifically suffer from an alcohol addiction. It offers people the support necessary to overcome their addiction and find the freedom they desire. An alcohol addiction centre provides various treatments and therapies that have proven to help people through their addiction to alcohol.

While overcoming an addiction to drugs can feel impossible, it’s important to know that people recover from drug addiction every day. While some people can quit using drugs on their own, most people need professional treatment to successfully overcome an addiction for good. This is because addiction itself is a multi-faceted, extremely complex condition.Receiving professional help at a drug rehab allows a person to look at each facet of their addiction and work through its complexities. As beneficial as drug rehab can be, it is only as effective as a person’s willingness to receive help. The results a person sees by going to drug rehab are largely dependent upon the attitude they have whilst receiving treatment.

Eating in PubsEating in Pubs in the UK and EuropeFormerly, this website was owned by Eating Pubs Limited, a company which used to list Traditional English Pubs & Pubs with Restaurants that serve really great food in Worcester, Upton-upon-Severn, Malvern, Pershore, Evesham,Tewksbury, Stratford-upon Avon, Droitwich & Bromyard.This food is soooo good. 
  Really? I-I-I can’t… I just can’t. I’m trying to watch my weight. Sticking to a specific diet here… 
 
On the site was information about the various restaurants and pubs in the area as well as their locations and times of operation. Generally, all the information that you’d need about the hotels, whether a traveler of a visitor holidaying in the area could be found on this site hence making it easy for you to make the right decision on where to dine or spend your evening.
There were links to the various hotels which enabled one to contact the hotel management and make reservations or inquiries.
Though I don’t hail from the place, I have had the opportunity to visit some eating places and pubs and will soon be sharing my experiences with you.
  I don’t always diet and exercise.  But when I do, I expect the results to be instant, dramatic, and spectacular. 
  Which technically means, stay away from delicious food you won’t be able to get enough of. Because you’ll blow up like a balloon. 
  I am in shape… ‘Round’ is a shape. 
 
Currently, I am repurposing this site and I do intend to also publish content about restaurants and pubs in these regions and also the greater England as was previously posted on the site. I’ve already collected some posts from my friends who have visited some of the hotels and will be glad to share with you. I have already published some of their experiences and you can access them by clicking through the various topics below.

Passionate About Food




 
I am an adventurous person who enjoys travelling a lot. I have two friends whom we share the same travelling passion and these are the people whom we travel with most of the times. Although we have visited many places we had not gotten a chance to visit England. But we always wanted to go to England mainly because of the many things we hear England has to offer. Recently we had planned to travel to England with my friends but they were both committed and so I had to travel alone. I A am a fun person and I make friends fast therefore I know even if I were alone I would have a good time.
My visit to England was to last a whole week and therefore I had a lot of time to sample the excitements the country has to offer. I started by doing research with the help of my friends on the main attractions, travel schedules and places to stay.
I was sure to make all the plans in advance including booking the hotels I was to stay in. The journey was smooth and I arrived safely at about noon. From the airport I took a taxi which took me to my hotel. The drier was very talkative and friendly and even though I was exhausted I enjoyed the ride to the hotel. I checked in and because I was tired I decided to take a nap as I prepared to start my adventure the following morning.
Despite my plans to start exploring England the following day, the moment I woke up at around seven in the evening I decided to enjoy a walk on the streets of London. The weather was calm and is I walked I passed a number of traditional English pubs which looked attractive but conservative at the same time. I had heard a lot about such pubs and so I decided to get into one. 
In the pub almost everyone was friendly and they noticed I was new because a waiter came immediately to take my order. Through research I had heard of certain delicacies and so I ordered stake and ale pie. I thought it would be odd to be eating in a pub but here everyone seemed to be ordering food together with a pint. The stake and ale pie were brought within no time and I got time to confirm why the foods sold in traditional English pubs were so popular all over the world.
I was seating next to a local guy who explained to me how eating some of the delicacies in pubs were traditions that has been kept going for a long time.
In the pub we sat for a couple of hours as I interacted with the other patrons over several pints. I even got to interact with other visitors who had also visited England to enjoy the many attractions. Those of us who were not locals seemed to worry about what we were eating and our diets especially me since I was on a weight loss program.  But to the locals this did not seem to be an issue as many people enjoyed some meals which might be considered to be unhealthy back home. 
However, despite my health concerns the foods were so tempting and I knew enjoying it for the time I was in England would not harm my health significantly. I also learnt that most traditional English pubs have a variety of foods which the customers can choose from. There are even options for vegetarians and therefore everybody was catered for.
From the pub and talking with the guys I headed back to my hotel and I got a taste of the London night life. The streets seemed so lively and secure where I just walked to my hotel without anyone even noting that I am not a local. 
I spent the following six days moving from one attraction to the other in the country. I got to take pictures in different land marks for memories sake and for my friends. Through my travel I noted that almost every area has the traditional pubs which serve both drinks and food. 
Despite the concerns about health issues such as a virus of the breast tissue many people seemed to enjoy the different types of meals offered in the restaurants and pubs. However I noted the number of people with weight problems was fewer in England than in back home.
By the time my time to leave England reached I had sampled a lot of different traditional foods and visited a lot of attractions. I liked the friendliness of the people and the rich traditions which have been passed on for generations. I also liked the food even though I was a little bit concerned with the way people were not observing their eating habit.
But I made a mental note that the eating habits were as a result of the food being so enticing. Back home after showing my friends the pictures I had taken and narrating my experiences they vowed the next time they get time they must visit England. There is no way I will let them enjoy the delicacies and attractions in England without me and therefore I can bet I will be back in England soon.Really? I-I-I can’t… I just can’t. I’m trying to watch my weight. Sticking to a specific diet here…

Recently we had planned to travel to England with my friends but they were both committed and so I had to travel alone. I A am a fun person and I make friends fast therefore I know even if I were alone I would have a good time.
My visit to England was to last a whole week and therefore I had a lot of time to sample the excitements the country has to offer. I started by doing research with the help of my friends on the main attractions, travel schedules and places to stay.
I was sure to make all the plans in advance including booking the hotels I was to stay in. The journey was smooth and I arrived safely at about noon. From the airport I took a taxi which took me to my hotel. The drier was very talkative and friendly and even though I was exhausted I enjoyed the ride to the hotel. I checked in and because I was tired I decided to take a nap as I prepared to start my adventure the following morning.
Despite my plans to start exploring England the following day, the moment I woke up at around seven in the evening I decided to enjoy a walk on the streets of London. The weather was calm and is I walked I passed a number of traditional English pubs which looked attractive but conservative at the same time. I had heard a lot about such pubs and so I decided to get into one. 
In the pub almost everyone was friendly and they noticed I was new because a waiter came immediately to take my order. Through research I had heard of certain delicacies and so I ordered stake and ale pie. I thought it would be odd to be eating in a pub but here everyone seemed to be ordering food together with a pint. The stake and ale pie were brought within no time and I got time to confirm why the foods sold in traditional English pubs were so popular all over the world.
I was seating next to a local guy who explained to me how eating some of the delicacies in pubs were traditions that has been kept going for a long time.
In the pub we sat for a couple of hours as I interacted with the other patrons over several pints. I even got to interact with other visitors who had also visited England to enjoy the many attractions. Those of us who were not locals seemed to worry about what we were eating and our diets especially me since I was on a weight loss program.  But to the locals this did not seem to be an issue as many people enjoyed some meals which might be considered to be unhealthy back home. 
However, despite my health concerns the foods were so tempting and I knew enjoying it for the time I was in England would not harm my health significantly. I also learnt that most traditional English pubs have a variety of foods which the customers can choose from. There are even options for vegetarians and therefore everybody was catered for.
From the pub and talking with the guys I headed back to my hotel and I got a taste of the London night life. The streets seemed so lively and secure where I just walked to my hotel without anyone even noting that I am not a local. 
I spent the following six days moving from one attraction to the other in the country. I got to take pictures in different land marks for memories sake and for my friends. Through my travel I noted that almost every area has the traditional pubs which serve both drinks and food. 
Despite the concerns about health issues such as a virus of the breast tissue many people seemed to enjoy the different types of meals offered in the restaurants and pubs. However I noted the number of people with weight problems was fewer in England than in back home.
By the time my time to leave England reached I had sampled a lot of different traditional foods and visited a lot of attractions. I liked the friendliness of the people and the rich traditions which have been passed on for generations. I also liked the food even though I was a little bit concerned with the way people were not observing their eating habit.
But I made a mental note that the eating habits were as a result of the food being so enticing. Back home after showing my friends the pictures I had taken and narrating my experiences they vowed the next time they get time they must visit England. There is no way I will let them enjoy the delicacies and attractions in England without me and therefore I can bet I will be back in England soon.I am in shape… ‘Round’ is a shape.

I’ve already collected some posts from my friends who have visited some of the hotels and will be glad to share with you.

Edinburgh Headway Group aims to empower and enrich the lives of adults who have survived an acquired brain injury. We do this by providing high quality person-centred rehabilitation services which support both adults with brain injuries and their carers.“Nothing Short of a Lifeline”Our  new video has been very kindly produced by Baillie Gifford’s creative film and photography team and we thank them for all their support and assistance with this production.Nothing Short of a Lifeline sheds light on just how lives and futures can be altered in an instant as a result of a brain injury.We know that brain injury can affect personalities as well as a person’s cognitive and physical abilities. But what is clear is that the experiences of those affected are unique and with the right help and support at the right time, there can be life after a brain injury.Please take this moment to hear the words of our members tell their stories:Brain injury affects who we are - the way we think, act and feel. It is unpredictable and can change everything in a matter of seconds. Individuals can experience a change of personality, loss of memory, impaired concentration, communication difficulties as well as other cognitive and physical problems which can be life-long. For their families and partners this change can be traumatic, as suddenly they find themselves as full-time carers. Often the most difficult effect is the total change in the nature and personality of an injured person. It can be like learning to live with a total stranger and this can have a devastating effect for all concerned.NHS Lothian provides valuable support for the costs of running Headway House and the City of Edinburgh Council currently funds the Carers Project.Much of the finance needed to cover the remainder of the operating costs is raised by donations and fundraising. So every donation is valuable and if you wish to help in this way please use our account at Just Giving.18 Dec 201817 Dec 2018There's a lot going on at Edinburgh Headway Group.  Click the link to find out the latest news.Registered Office:

Embryonic stem cells have triggered a lot of debate amongst religious people, political figures, the general public and even a minority of scientists.Those who oppose embryonic stem cell research liken the destruction of an embryo to an abortion. They think that the embryo is alive because of its potential to develop into a human being. Opponents of embryonic stem cell use claim that it is unethical to end one life in order to save another.Those who believe in embryonic stem cell research say that an embryo does not constitute as human life because it has not been born. Believers also contend that the costs of several diseases and illnesses, both financially and emotionally, mean that the moral concerns around embryonic stem cell usage are not enough to justify an end to stem cell research.It is improbable that a comprehensive solution will be discovered for the embryonic stem cell discussion anytime soon. Meanwhile, policies within the country and internationally, as well as the collective public views will probably guide the research and therapy efforts stem cell research. There is no question that stem cells have a huge potential for treating disease but regrettably doubts still persist as to the ethical and moral implications of pursuing this potential.Continue readingStem cells have the ability to change into several different cell types in the body during early life and development. Additionally, in several tissues they serve as a kind of repair system for the human body, dividing limitlessly to replenish other cells so long as the human or animal remains alive. When a stem cell splits, new cells have the potential to remain either a stem cell or become a different kind of cell with a more distinctive role, such as a muscle cell, a red blood cell or a brain cell.Scientific studies of stem cells allow scientists to discover the cells’ essential properties and what differentiates them from specialized cell types. Scientists have begun to use stem cells in the laboratory to screen new drugs and to develop systems to study normal growth and observe the causes of birth defects.Stem cells have huge potential in health and medical research but to completely harness this potential, scientists are investigating how stem cells change into the broad variety of specialised cells that make people what they are today. Because illnesses like cancer and conditions such as birth defects are thought to occur due to problems in the differentiation process, an appreciation of the development that takes place in normal cells will enable scientists to treat the developmental issues that can occur.Some of the medical areas which stem cells can benefit are:Parkinson's disease2016 Copyright Stem cell research information - eescn.org.uk All rights reserved.

Business information modeling (BIM) is considered to the finest choice in airport infrastructure design. This can be backed by the fact with the new London’s Gatwick Airport. The project is ending with a budget of $1.2 billion used in the process of modernization of its infrastructure.United Kingdom BIM consulting initiative kick-started the project and aimed at reducing the cost of the project by twenty percent. It also aimed at reducing the UK’s carbon intensity. The project utilized the Autodesk technology and attained success.The most difficult challenge faced by the project was to din a way to improve the association between several thousand contractors involved in the project. All need to meet the timelines and equally care must be taken in not disturbing the thirty-four million people who use the airport during the entire year.  BIM modeling for the infrastructure made the team make things easy. Close to 250 individual projects were efficiently collaborated by BIM to bring the project to completion.The primary reason behind using BIM in the London Gatwick Airport is to model the energy performance. It helped in minimizing the waste during the construction process. It improved both the construction efficiency and the operation efficiency. Environment quality of the interior also has boosted to a higher level.The significant benefit of BIM is the complexity. Contrasting the older and the traditional modeling opportunities, BIM allows everyone in the infrastructure project to provide a range of variables into a remarkable system, and that helps to create a complete model.BIM is a process that makes use of the original model and facilitates simulation, analysis, and coordination of the infrastructure projects. It also helps in operations, maintenance and asset management.BIM enables quick and proficient planning of both the exterior and the interior areas of the Airport. BIM design plans about the evacuation routes and road, rail connections all link based on the space required for the airport to function.Denver International Airport stands as the foremost example due to the BIM process.BIM can span across the complete process of the Airport construction infrastructure. One of the greatest practices that make BIM best suited for airport projects is its multiple source inputs. To get the optimal result, BIM airport project makes use of BIM by involving all the stakeholders right from the project planning.Continuous data update process followed by BIM model enables it to be the vibrant powerhouse for infrastructure projects. The intricacy of a building information model makes it an essential forecasting tool.BIM model-based loom helps a speedy construction pace with harmonized development timelines and Inspiring teamwork around a central model made the airport project a great success.Thus BIM has proven its efficiency in offering success in airport infrastructure design with the latest London’s Gatwick Airport completion.Load in data cables is enormous and therefore the installation techniques must be such that this issue is handled in the best manner. There are several techniques which can be followed by data cabling services and will make sure that the overall issue is not faced and cables remain at the top of their performance. The reliability and working in cable based components should also be increased. If there is any issue regarding the cables then it can also be handled in case of efficient cable installation. The basic components which are to be taken care of in this regard are as follows. These components make sure that the best and state of the art outcome is generated and installation techniques remain at the top of its performance. These techniques will also ensure that the overall components upgrade is easy. These components are high in number and some of the important aspects in this regard are as follows:There is a limit of installation of every cable and this should be done in a manner that cable endures stress. The cable can be put into the place or it can be placed in pipes. Whatever the case is this aspect should be covered. There are many issues which can be faced if the cable’s installation limit is reached. It can break the cable and can also hinder the signals in this regard. The other issues which can be faced in this regard and can degrade the overall performance. The level of the cable should also be kept in such a manner that the cable remains steady.The temperature should also remain one of the primary factors which are to be considered. The placement of cable should be done with extreme precision. The servers emit the extreme amount of heat and it could damage the cabling. The cable layers should be placed in such a manner that the servers never present any issue to them. It also means that the overall performance remains up to the mark.  Wide spaces in the server room should be utilized in this regard which will do the trick for the users. The temperature should never present a threat to cabling that is done. Temperature can damage the cables and therefore it is very important to save cable from this issue.There are many ways in which a cable can be installed efficiently using lubricants. This ensures that the cables neither twist nor bend while tight spaces are utilized for the installation. The cable paths can also be determined by the building services hired and it can also make sure that the overall issues are not only resolved but never present a threat to cable installation. Traditional methods cannot be used in this regard such as the ones used in electrical methods. Such methods can make sure that the cables bend, twist and break. The tubes through which the cables are passed can also be kept loose so that strain and stress issues are never faced at all.Currently in the sphere of virtual safety there are more and more laws, which are prohibiting access to these or those websites.

According to the fact that nanotechnology products have a huge impact on our life, due to the fact, that more than 1300 tools are considered to be manufacture-based. For example, there are touch screens in IPhones and Ipads, cosmetics, sunscreens and so long.Nanotechnologies could also convert some trash into something up-to-date and useful. By the way such method could remove different air toxins and clean environment. We could help solve ecological problem because new materials are not created, but the old one transformed and advanced. Nano robots are also could create something without the special need of deforestation or obtaining the oil.Nanotechnologies have impressive and at the same way slightly notable changes in economic. The thing is that the world’s development requires numerous working places for skilled and interested in recent developments workers, scientists, teachers, doctors and researchers. Their mission to create and developed concepts of nanotechnologies and share this valuable knowledge with other members of society. These changes are really noticeable in business cause many of prominent and famous companies compete with other. The only enterprise which could suggest modern and iconoclastic ideas will win the tender and have tremendous income.As far as medical sphere is concerned, researches came up with idea to make scope for miles better because it would help to solve numerous medical problems. As it was predicted, nanoscopes exceeds all expectations and considered the best choice for every lab. In fact, UK leading LIG Tech optical nanoscope is used in order to upgrade ordinary microscopes without putting extra efforts. It features maximum resolution objective lens that show well-defined outcome. Nano scopes provide with clear picture of viruses and cells that could be observed and studied.  Watching them through the nano scope, scientists and lab workers could analyze their models of behavior and jump into conclusion how to treat this or that illness.

The marketing activities as a rule touch the following areas in this case: product policy, price policy, distribution and sales policy and communication policy. Trade policy in this case forms forms the core that gathers other decisions relating to the terms of the acquisition of goods and promotion methods.Trade policy of the Internet has its own characteristics, conditioned by the characteristics of web audience, specific features of the processes of communication and some other factors. In some cases, such as in digital products, Internet preexisting principles of the industry radically change, as the cost of reproduction and delivery of such products can be non-significant.Along with a revolutionary impact on the commodity policy of the Internet has had a powerful impact on the services sector, further strengthening the existing trend of their universal extension. Thus, the provision of information through the Internet, regardless whether it is financial, tourist or educational services, have become an integral part of the modern world.Internet has become a major distribution channel for products and its share in many sectors has already exceeded offline purchases. From the first commodities: books, audio and video CDs (physical entities), the technology went beyond and revolutionised the products themselves, turning physical services into online subscriptions, DVD movies into downloadable files and so on. According to HTP, digital marketing Manchester agency specialising on online marketing and digital presence management, internet will even change the way people perceive the way they use things in physical world with the introduction of virtual reality technologies. But that’s the future.

The article is prepared in collaboration with Telling Company experts, a successful UK-based engineering enterprise, massively utilising hydraulic lime, lime mortar and concrete solutions in its projects. Read More ?Magnetic cranes are referred to a special type and designed for lifting and transporting ferromagnetic materials (scrap metals, chips, sheets, molds for casting and so on). These cranes are equipped with cargo electromagnets, hung on a hook suspension or traverse (on a floppy or hard suspension) located in the longitudinal or transverse direction of the bridge.Magnetic cranes production is a prerogative of large scale businesses: the United Kingdom example is Granada Material Handling, a prosperous company with 14 years of track record, focusing on production, as well as lifting equipment inspection and lifting equipment services. The company’s pipeline gives birth to a variety of magnetic equipment types: here is a specifications breakdown (approximate data, the average values and serial production machines are considered).The most common among these cranes are the systems with single wall beams and auxiliary farms, as well as double-girder box-like structure with high resistance to fatigue.Read More ?Fittings is a collective term for all the connective elements, installed in branching points, contractions and bends. These devices allow sealed blocking of traffic flow and, at the same time, simplify the process of assembling and disassembling the pipeline. A fitting may be made of metal or of softer materials; threaded, welded and tube fittings are the most common models, while flanges form a special group. Read More ?Covered parking lots, multi-surface and underground parking sites represent the essential features of a modern urban landscape, ensuring the safety of vehicles. But not every car owner is aware about the security threats posed at these undeniably useful facilities.Taking into account the fact that virtually any parking is primarily a substantial accumulation of cars in a confined space, there are two main points, constituting a menace to people and their vehicles to be noted:Therefore, the business plan of indoor (and primarily multilevel) lots should include the availability of sufficiently powerful ventilation and smoke detection mechanisms that can continuously provide the required ventilation. Of course, such internal engineering systems, structures and networks increase the cost of construction and maintenance of the car parking, but ultimately these systems increase the level of fire protection and environmental safety significantly.In addition, no state supervisory authority responsible for environmental control will permit the exploitation of the facility without a decent installing car park ventilation system up and running, not to mention smoke protection mechanisms. In addition, such facilities should be used in full accordance with the rules of technical operation of the vehicle.Another fact to underline is that the complexes put into operation decades ago are forced to integrate new parking ventilation systems according to standards adopted in the overwhelming majority of countries worldwide.Glass reinforced concrete is fairly considered to be one of the most versatile building materials that stand in the service of modern architects and designers. The material production technology was developed over thirty years ago and since then glass reinforced concrete  has managed to establish itself as an indispensable tool and made ??a significant contribution to the economy, technology and aesthetics of the building industry.

Playing with tall pillars, combining lighting elements, bollards and built-in lighting fixtures, you can create a dynamic lighting system capable of covering the entire area: from the treetops and roofs of the cottage to the pool or flowerbeds. Street lighting experts are trying to cover all possible genres, offering lamps of country, Empire, Baroque, Art Nouveau and even Victorian street lighting styles. Therefore, the collections of the German, Italian and UK factories are typically represented by myriads of highly-functional lamps, suitable for the most intricate designs. Consider the option of acquiring forged fittings that resonates with lines and shadows and look stunningly beautiful. Just like in fashion industry, lighting design offers its own tendencies and trends virtually each season to complement the most exquisite terrace designs.Read More ?Oil and gas borehole drilling implies using rotational method exclusively, carrying the rock particles to the surface through circulating fluid jet. Depending on the location of the engine the drilling techniques are divided into two major groups: rotor drilling, when the engine is installed on the surface, activating the drill bit at the bottom by rotating the entire drill string and downhole motor drilling that demands using a drill motor or turbine when the engine is located close to the borehole above the drill bit. Read More ?The British government intend to reform a no win no fee system became obvious when Ken Clarke, UK Justice Minister, made an announcement on March 13, 2011. Initially, it was assumed that the new success fee rules will take effect from October 2012.Clark suggested that legal fees should not be covered by the losing party, but deducted from the compensation due to the winning party. According to the head of the Ministry of Justice, the plans aimed at making the justice system more balanced and equally fair for all the parties. At the same time the government was in favor of limiting attorneys’ fees to 25% from compensation in contrast to the earlier proposal for 10 percent of the amount. The government’s proposal was supported by parliamentarians, but the authoritative figures expressed concern that the government’s plans can go too far. According to them, the desire to limit the success fee could lead to the lawyers’ dramatically low interest even in the accident claims doomed for success. Indeed, judging by the tendencies at Solicitors Guru, the largest platform that gathers hundreds of licensed lawyers and agencies in the country, the branch is flourishing, pop in and find a solicitor.A no win, no fee system was introduced in the UK as a result of the reform of the judicial system, held in 1999. It enabled solicitors to operate within the framework of conditional fee arrangement. With the introduction of this system an ‘After the Event’ insurance mechanism was born. These actions contributed to a real revolution: the system has become extremely actively used by both providers and consumers.Initially, the government believed that the reforms, carried into effect, will make a solid contribution into more accessible legal services. Additionally, such rules should have become a perfect incentive for a lawyer: thus, the center of gravity shifts to an overall success of the case, not on the time spend to achieve positive results. So if you want know more about practical matter of this – read detailed explanations of no win no fee conception on the specialized source.As almost any prosperous industry, ultrasonic cleaning doesn’t stand still – the engineers are grinding away to integrate new methodologies and approaches into practice. Mentioned below is the list of noteworthy technologies that are not yet integrated on industrial level. Read More ?The greater Leeds is crossed by M1 motorway and a range of highway, including A58, A62, A63, A64, A65. M1 is one of the most important transport arteries of England that connects Leeds with London. A58 leads to Prescott, A62 to Manchester, A63 to Kingston, A64 to Scarborough and A65 to Cumbria. Due to a highly developed road system and a broad variety of hotels in Leeds, the popularity of the city grows among auto tourists exponentially.In the 60s of the last century an extremely ambitious project of circumferential highway has been implemented in the city. A good part of the road falls to the share of underground tunnels. Thus, in contrast to Birmingham, Leicester and many other cities in England, Leeds has managed to minimize the damage caused to an ancient look and feel by the development of the transport system. Therefore, with a sweeping selection of accommodation options, including totally affordable serviced apartments Leeds offers legions of tourists to plunge into an ancient atmosphere of the city.Some shopping streets in the central part of Leeds (e.g. Brigat) are closed for vehicles. In early 2006 the free bus route has been launched due to the initiative of city authorities: the form of public transport that exists in many European cities is highly appreciated by the tourists. The trams have been abolished in November 1959; today the city is considering the option of introducing trolleybus routes. The ‘Next generation transport’, held in Leeds in 2009, resulted into a new initiative to reincarnate trolleybus tradition in the city. The city estimates the implementation of a new project at 280 million pounds, while the launch of the new type of public transport is scheduled for the year of 2015. However, a similar initiative has been declined by the government in 2004." 46555.0 0.0 Estar

Dark Star Pubs - Top Quality Themed PubsTheme pubs – Where the theme is great beer...Whilst all of our pubs are very different, we like to think that two common threads hold them together: the love of great beer from the great breweries we’re lucky enough to have in this country, and the provision of a place for people to get together and share life experiences. As well as information about our pubs, events etc, we’ll also look to provide details of events at pubs we tend to spend our spare time and money in, such as The Royal Oak in Friday Street and The Snowdrop in Lewes, oh and The Brewers Arms in Lewes…you get the picture.

Health, life and capacity for work are the values on which the family and social well-being of each modern person is built. A person’s health is the capital, which every successful person is trying to maintain it at a high level throughout life. The foreign and domestic researches are showing that the risk of dying from medical malpractice, medical negligence or medical errors is the tens and hundreds of times higher than the one in car accidents, air crashes and etc.To get any service, we are guided by the previously acquired experiences. So, when buying food products in the store, we check its appearance and features; when hiring a carpenter we tend to check a portfolio; going to a hairdresser, we can calculate precisely how we will look in 20-30 minutes; signing a mortgage, a loan agreement for the years ahead, we foresee the result.However, when getting medical service, in most cases, we can guess and hope for the results in medical intervention, and the probabilities here could be numerous. By agreeing to have a complicated abdominal surgery, most people refer to the risk of medical errors with ‘understanding’; psychologically, some are even ready death, especially if a consent is signed, notifying them of the likelihood of death.That is, people are mostly ‘humanly’ ready to forgive a physician incompetency, medical negligence or medical error.
In everyday life the risk may be justified only if the person possessing a full and objective information on the factors influencing the occurrence of adverse events to their health and takes his own conscious decision to act.At the same time, perceiving the mandatory approval of the attending physician for the ultimate truth, we deliberately abandon many civil rights; for example – informed consent, holding a consultation in the presence of a medical lawyer and etc.Medicine around the world – is primarily a huge-profit business. The experience of medical lawyers organisations and medical negligence solicitors, dealing with the protection of the rights of patients, shows that 50-70% of the official information contained in the medical records is at least partially false, and therefore does not reflect an objective picture of the health status of the patient.Most probably you haven’t noticed that healthcare workers and doctors do not like the ‘witnesses’ in the course of the conversation or consultation with the patient or during medical procedures. Of course, it is explained by a good number of factors, but partially, it is a defensive position depriving you from certain evidence in the future (in the event something goes wrong). Most investigations into medical error ‘stumble’ on the facts of false information contained in the medical records and medical history, concealing medical errors. When having a closer look on the state of affairs, different facts become obvious. Thus, in an NPR article it is said the amount of lethal outcomes caused by medical errors and negligence in the US accounts for around 444,000 annually, not 44,000 – 78,000 according to the official statistics.Patients should be confident that they, along with their doctor, have decided to conduct a surgery or to take medication with possible side effects; thus, in the event of an unfavorable outcome of the treatment the results are more likely to be perceived as associated risks, not as negligence of the physician. Errors in relationship between doctors and patients are not rare in medical practice; reducing their number can be achieved by relationships of trust, based on the achievements of modern medical science, compliance technologies and high level of staff.As a rule, the causes of conflict on the basis of dissatisfaction of patients of treatment are:(more…)Historians still argue about the authorship of the ‘Errare humanum est’ (Humans tend to make mistakes) expression, which later became winged. Some believe that it was first uttered in the V century BC by Greek poet Euripides. Others argue that Cicero, who once said, ‘To err is human, but the one persisting in errors is a fool’; another popular remark mentions the doctors of antiquity, who used to say that medicine is the history of human errors.
Talking about human mistakes and errors is difficult, especially when it comes to health care services. Nevertheless, there is no sphere of activity, where the issue has been studied as thoroughly as in medicine. This is due to the fact that the consequences of the doctor’s mistake are especially serious and may lead to a disability or even death.The reasons behind errors can be either objective or subjective. The first type is mostly associated with diversity of views in the treatment of certain diseases. The therapeutic complex of measures, which was previously considered to be the most efficient, from the point of view of modern scientific approaches can be regarded to as incorrect. It also comprises errors made by doctors in their interaction with patients by virtue of non-compliance with basic deontological principles. Any doctor is not free from professional mistakes, just like any representative of any specialty. However, due to the peculiarities of their profession, their work acquires an increased social significance. A pilot error, resulting in the death of hundreds of people at the same time, for some reason, is treated as a ‘human factor’. Maybe this is due to the peculiarities of the profession. (more…)In judicial practice the number of cases when the clinic is also held liable for the acts of one of its employees is slowly, but gradually increasing. The situation becomes more complicated if a medical error occurred after, for example, the physician sent a patient for further treatment to other specialists. If the damage is caused by employee of the clinic, the patient can use several options to protect their violated rights: to file a claim against a particular individual (a physician), by the virtue of efforts of which, in his opinion, the damage was made; against the clinic or against both, attracting clinic as a respondent. In practice, a better part of claims is brought against the health institutions (clinics). Importantly, an institution’s (clinic) responsibilities include: providing medical care for patients and being liable for the negligence of its employees.The issue of liability of clinic currently remains a controversial and debated question, not only in the legal literature, but also in judicial practice. The decision on this important issue also depends on the health system adopted in the state or region and the relations that govern patient-doctor relations by the law. This issue has repeatedly been considered at the highest level and in the jurisprudence of the Anglo-American legal system, where the approach to it is quite flexible.In Australia, in Ellis case against Hospital in Wallsend District the Court has made a decision by a majority vote, that ‘the clinic is jointly and severally liable in cases where the patient can go directly to the hospital for treatment or consultation. This responsibility does not occur when the clinic simply provides that services used treatment approaches used in their institution’.In another case, the Ontario Court of Appeal decided that ‘the duties are not limited to a simple hospital hiring of competent staff’. In establishing the fact whether there was the fact of negligence, the courts adheres to the same definitions that are used in the determination of any other civil lawsuits or criminal cases. Therefore, in the UK the narrow specialisation is on the rise – according to Solicitors.Guru, one of the largest legal databases in the UK where anyone can find a solicitor easily, the number of medical negligence solicitors has increased by 15% in comparison with 2014.(more…)In medical practice, ‘accident’ is widely utilised, which in its origin is substantially different from a medical error, because it does not depend on any actions or omissions of the physician. However, an ‘accident’ is treated as a medical error until the circumstances and details are figured out. The majority of professionals use the term ‘accident’ in situations where an unfavorable outcome is related to accidental circumstances, ‘force majeure’, ie the outcome doctor simply couldn’t foresee and prevent. The accidents include:(more…)Medical errors are considered to be improper acts or omissions in the performance of professional duties by a health care worker, which are not the result of bad faith and do not have signs of a crime or misdemeanor.The concept of ‘medical error’ itself is not new, and even the appropriate penalties have been issued throughout the history of mankind. In Roman law the term ‘error’ was widely used, including the cases related to medical practice (Aquilia law). The concept included inexperience, negligence, and failure to provide assistance. In the 19th century progressive doctors have seen throughout the analysis and study of medical errors came to a conclusion that their elimination bears a major potential for healthcare area improvement. Ralph Emerson wrote that every conscientious person, especially a teacher, must have an inner need to publish error and therefore warn less competent people.

By adminOn February 24, 2017In sorting your moneyA no credit check easy cash loan is regularly sought to help with a financial emergency. The absence of credit scoring means that this type of short term loan is suitable for those with a very poor credit history. The lending criteria for an easy cash advance is vastly different to a traditional bank loan. Rather than assessing the borrower’s repayment history, the lender checks to ensure that the customer can afford to clear the debt and/or recover their money in the event of default.Where to Apply for an Easy Cash LoanBorrowing money with bad credit can be very difficult, but payday lenders, pawn shops and credit unions specialise in helping those who the banks are no longer prepared to assist. The lending criteria do vary considerably. Those who aren’t eligible for a payday advance loan may find that they are able to get approval for a pawnbroker loan.A Bad Credit Loan from a PawnbrokerWhilst payday lenders offer unsecured loans, pawnbrokers lend money more liberally due to the provision of collateral. Provided that the borrower is able to provide an item of value (gold, silver or jewelry), he/she will be eligible for a pawn shop loan. The items value will be assessed and an easy cash loan will be provided on the basis of this valuation. If a borrower doesn’t redeem the item (by clearing the short term loan and any interest that has accrued), the item will eventually be sold.No Credit Check Payday Advance LoansIt may be possible to get an unsecured cash loan from a payday lender. It typically costs $20 to $25 to borrow $100 for a calendar month. The borrower must be a U.S. citizen, 18-years of age and in full-time employment. They will also need a valid checking account and be able to provide at least 2 forms of identification (one of which must be photo ID). Provided that the application is received prior to 2.30 PM, a payday advance loan will reach the borrower’s bank account on the same working day.Short Term Loan from a Credit UnionIn order to get an easy cash loan from a credit union, it is necessary to be a member. People are able to join on a number of different grounds, such as locality, vocation and religion. Although working purely for the interests of their members, the cost of a credit union loan is about the same as a payday advance loan. However, in the event of financial difficulties, a credit union is far more likely to show sympathy than a payday lender. The only obstacle borrowers face is the time period it takes to become a member.By adminOn February 24, 2017In sorting your moneyCredit Cards– some people might think of this as a dirty word; others might think of it as their saving grace. No matter what your stance on credit cards may be there are many pros and cons to owning and using one.When I was 18, I got my first credit card offer in the mail. As a person who is very bad at saving money, I quickly responded “YES! SIGN ME UP!” and was soon sent a nice pink plastic card that, in my young eyes, was the key to open so many doors for things I never was able to afford. I was soon purchasing an Mp3 player, shoes, purses, you name it, but I was soon rudely awakened by my credit card bill. The minimum payment was only $10, so I thought, my minimum wage job would be fine to cover it! In no time I had maxed out my card, and decided to sign up for another so that I could buy groceries while my paycheck went to paying down my first credit card. I tell you this because this is the slippery slope which many Americans have slipped. Credit can seem like an easy end, a great short term solution, but with credit, unless you plan to pay the balance off immediatly, the credit card companies will always win.Store credit cards are one area where many people get easily trapped. Many stores will offer a discount to those holding a credit line with them, for example they might have a 30% discount for thier card holders– the trick is that you are already paying a 20-30% interest rate, so the discount is actually just giving you store price! What you once saw as a great deal you will now be paying for over a longer period ot time. One major downfall of credit cards in general, not just store cards, is that the interest will end up being the bulk of the balance if you let it get out of hand, and that $12 pizza or that $38 handbag that you just had to have, now costs $50 or higher, and you are paying for it long after the item itself is gone. I know I personally am still paying for groceries that I bought as a freshman in college!Credit Cards, when used responsibly, can be a good thing, however. Building your credit, especially as a young person, can be very important if you ever want to get a car loan or a mortgage–having a credit card with a small balance that you pay on time every month can help to build good credit.Credit can also be very helpful when you need some money in case of an emergency, like having a credit card that you keep just for auto emergencies or medical expenses.This can be extremely important when your car needs a new transmission and you have already emptied your savings account trying to pay for just the labor costs alone and its not even finished. Many people also keep an emergency credit card in case they became stranded while on a trip and unable to get home on time, this will help ease the stress of paying a few extra nights for a hotel.Credit Cards can also make shopping a breeze, which is great especially if you are someone who does not have a lot of time to wait around in line at a store; and when you do have to go to the store the card is so easy to use, no more digging in your pockets for change or emptying your purse to find that extra dollar that you just know you have somewhere.Another major benefit of a credit card is security. If you lose your cash, or if it is stolen, there is no way to claim what was taken, however if you use a credit card that becomes lost or stolen, you can report it to the company that issued it and many times the company will refund the amount that the theif used and refund any fees incurred by the theft.Overall Credit does not have to be a scary thing, When used responsibly it can help to open a few doors, but when abused it can cause many more doors to close. With hope, credit card can one day cease to be a dirty word.Powered by WordPress & Theme by Anders Norén" 47791.0 0.0 "Fakenham Web – Getting Fakenham Online"

Farm Animal Rescue Sanctuary, based in Warwickshire (Shakespeare country), is a wonderful animal sanctuary established single handedly by Carole Webb in 1988. It is currently home to more than 480 farm animals and at its peak, Carole has cared for over 800 animals at one time.The animals residing at the sanctuary come from far and wide arriving in various states of health, many having been rescued from dreadful cruelty and/or poor living conditions. Some of our animals have escaped the horrendous ""Live Export Trade"". A lucky few have found their way to Farm Animal Rescue Sanctuary but the unfortunate majority are left to cope, for as the need to profit increases so man's compassion lessens and the victims continue to suffer. Whether they be exhausted cull ewes that have been forced to breed beyond any capacity that nature intended, or animals badly injured due to careless and rapid loading onto ill designed transporters, these animals have suffered a lot and they deserve the peace they now enjoy.  Creatures which are too often dismissed as stupid and worthless, show remarkable intelligence and gentleness once you've dispelled their fear.Farm Animal Rescue Sanctuary is managed by founder Carole Webb as a non-profit organisation and will always remain as such. All time is volunteered, no wages to pay, no offices to maintain - every penny goes to our animals to feed, shelter and provide medical care. Our running costs however, are very high and we have to rely upon a sympathetic public to help fund the sanctuary. Our membership may be small but their loyalty is unmatched.  For several years, we have achieved part funding through our animal adoption scheme which has become a popular gift item among our supporters, their friends and our website visitors, but we still suffer a huge shortfall.Ultimately, our most important TARGET must be to secure a monthly income to enable us to continue our good work and safeguard the haven we have provided for these animals.If you would like to help our sanctuary, please give donation HERE. Any size gift is most welcome and gratefully received. Thank you.Farm Animal Rescue Sanctuary's mission is to provide a safe and peaceful environment, where rescued animals can remain for the rest of their lives. Veterinary care and medication is provided as required and all animals in our charge are constantly monitored to ensure their good health and well being. We never implement euthanasia unless it is advised by our vet as a total necessity.Click HereURGENT WINTER FEED APPEAL 2018 - 19 Can you help?" 48006.0 0.0 "Farm Animal Rescue Sanctuary (UK) - Adopt a Farm Animal!

“Manchester United’s Paul Pogba is in red hot
form over the festive period”
(CC by 4.0) by ArdfernWith gameweek 20 behind us, we’ve true and well kicked off the second half of the 2018-19 Premier League season. We’ve also reached the last fixture of the relentless festive period, the end of a run of eight rounds in just over three weeks, as gameweek 22 starts on January 12th. While this might represent a welcome break for FPL managers, there’s no such luck for the real-time PL managers. Between January 4th and January 12th, the third round of the FA Cup will be played, while Manchester City, Chelsea and Spurs will also be playing their respective League Cup semi-finals. These encounters will surely have an impact on the starting line-ups for gameweek 22, so try to keep an eye on the Cup developments as well.Some observations ahead of gameweek 21We’ve been trying to temper the enthusiasm surrounding
Mourinho’s departure from the United bench, in part due to the club’s easy
fixture schedule of the past weeks, but the Red Devils really do seem
invigorated. Against Bournemouth at Old Trafford, United booked a third
consecutive victory, making it three in three for caretaker manager Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer. They’ve shown plenty of attacking intent over that period, scoring
12 goals in those three games. A reason for slight worry might be that they’ve
also conceded three goals, one in each game, against some of the lowest-scoring
outfits in the league (Cardiff and Huddersfield). Few will care about that at
the moment though, and most few will be looking forward to another winning
performance at Saint James’ Park coming Wednesday.One of the weekend’s surprise results was the Wolves away victory over Spurs on Saturday. The home team put in a fine performance in the first half and went into the break 1-0 ahead, courtesy of a fantastic left-foot strike by Harry Kane. The Wolves were probably content to make it to that point with minimal damage, but the outlook was completely different in the second half. Spurs seemed drained and Wolves slowly found their way back into the game, with Willy Boly’s powerful header drawing the score 1-1. It was all downhill for Spurs from there, and it was hard not to notice the lack of energy and conviction in the team as time advanced. They’ve had a great first half of the season, but they’d be wise to use the winter transfer window to deepen their squad a bit, especially considering the fact that they’re still active on four fronts: the Premier League, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the League Cup.The fact that Cardiff are in 16th place after the first half of the season is also worth mentioning. When the Bluebirds clinched promotion, they looked like they would be one of the nailed-on candidates for relegation. When they just spent £28 million on incoming players during the summer transfer window, it looked like it was going to be more than a tough season for them. Twenty one weeks later, Neil Warnock’s men are in 16th place, with 18 points and a team that seems to be settling in the League. Last weekend’s away game to Leicester, the team that had triumphed against Man City just a few days earlier, ended in a 0-1 victory for the Bluebirds, their first away victory of the season. If they can limit the damage against Spurs coming Tuesday, the club might be starting 2019 well above the drop zone, a position they’ll be more than happy to be at after gameweek 38.At the top of the table, Liverpool took the opportunity to show Arsenal coach Unai Emery that his Gunners are still some way off from challenging for the title. Sure, Arsenal have had an unbeaten run of 20+ games and their attacking play looks impressive at times, but last weekend’s game at Anfield showed that Liverpool (and the likes of City, Spurs and even Chelsea) are still a few steps ahead. What especially stands out is Arsenal’s defensive vulnerability, because conceding 30 goals in 20 games is no feat of a title challenger. The 5-1 drubbing by Liverpool will have hurt, so a home match against Fulham on New Year’s Day could be the perfect way to regain some confidence and get back to winning ways.Premium picksWe hoped you liked our ‘punt’ Premium Pick last gameweek of Firmino who banged in 3 goals and 17 points to be the 2nd highest gameweek scorer, second only to Pogba who we tipped as the Gameweek Captain. This week we’re start by looking at Arsenal’s home encounter with Fulham which stands out this round. Despite the Gunners coming off a painful 5-1 defeat to Liverpool and Fulham booking a 1-0 victory over fellow strugglers Huddersfield, a result of which the clean sheet will have especially pleased manager Claudio Ranieri. Still, Arsenal versus Fulham could well become a goal bonanza and Gunner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£11.4m) would be the one to benefit from such a game. The Gabonese striker is the current Premier League top scorer and Fulham is still the team with the league’s leakiest defense: 43 goals conceded in 20 games. Over the last three gameweeks, the Cottagers have allowed 32 attempts on goal (18 of which came from inside the area), and after a quiet and undoubtedly very frustrating game at Anfield, Aubameyang will be looking to get back to scoring ways in gameweek 21.Our second premium pick of the week had a quiet gameweek 20, but we’re counting on Eden Hazard (£11.1m) to deliver the goods yet again against Southampton at home on Wednesday. The Belgian was placed on the left wing again after a few weeks as Chelsea’s “false nine”, which pitted him against the tireless Aaron Wan-Bissaka and saw him appear less in Palace’s danger area. The Eagles tend to count on their solid defense anyway, so while the Hazard blank will have disappointed many, don’t worry. He was still very close to a couple of assists (both shots ended up against the woodwork) and he still recorded 33 points over the past four gameweeks. Hazard has provided attacking returns in 14 of the 19 Premier League in which he featured, resulting in his current totals of 10 goals and 9 assists. The Saints have conceded 9 goals in the 5 games under Ralph Hasenhüttl, but what might be more worrying is the number of attempts the team has allowed in the last three games: 16 vs Huddersfield in gameweek 18, 16 vs West Ham in gameweek 19, and 14 vs Man City last weekend. Southampton will also be missing their Captain, Hojbjerg, who covers a lot of ground in midfield, following his red card against Man City. Eden Hazard will be licking his lips in anticipation.When a player scores 4 goals, provides 4 assists, and brings home 46 FPL points in his last three games, we can’t afford not to mention him as a premium pick. We recommended Paul Pogba (£8.1m) as a prime candidate for the captaincy last weekend and the Frenchman delivered: 2 goals, 1 assist and 18 points to top score for GW20. He also hit the woodwork and was the player with most passes in the game, which shows just how central he is to the new manager’s more attacking approach. Next up is an away game at Newcastle, where the home team have conceded 15 goals in 10 games so far this season, a run from which they’ve taken just 7 points. Only Huddersfield have performed worse in home games. Pogba has the form and he has the fixture, and at his current price, he’s an absolute steal.A differential pick or twoOur first differential
pick for gameweek 21 is based more on what’s about to come than what has
happened recently. Lucas Moura (£6.9m) recorded 11 points against Wolves
in gameweek 19, courtesy of a goal and an assist, but the Brazilian dribbler
had been blanking for a period of three weeks prior to that. Overall, the first
half of his 2018-19 campaign has been pretty decent, with 6 goals, 2 assists,
and 84 FPL points, and he could find himself among the points again on a
regular basis soon. It’s doubtful whether or not he’ll start away to Cardiff on
Tuesday (keep an eye on the Spurs team news), but in-form attacker Son
Heung-Min will be off for the Asian Cup soon and Moura seems poised to take his
place. The Spurs schedule is relatively kind between now and gameweek 27, and
at a price of £6.9 million (and an ownership of just 8.6%), the Brazilian could
be a great differential.This week’s second differential pick is Fulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic (£6.7m) who we also tipped last week and were rewarded with a goal. This is even more of a punt, seeing as the Cottagers are visiting Arsenal at the Emirates on Tuesday, but it might just pay out. The Serbian striker was a one-man attack force against the Terriers last weekend, with his tireless efforts culminating in the first and only goal of the game, in the 91th minute. He could’ve had another one less than ten minutes earlier, but team mate Kamara demanded to take the penalty that he would eventually miss. Mitrovic took 5 shots at goal, of which 2 were on target, and he also created one key chance for a team mate. Fulham will definitely not visit Arsenal thinking they’re taking the three points back home, but they will create chances against the Gunners, as all teams do. Emery’s men have conceded 9 goals in 10 home games, and the Gunners defense could be suffering against the Serbian striker’s relentless physical style. Like we said, a real punt, but an interesting one.The captaincyArsenal hosting Fulham in gameweek 21 is such a juicy fixture on paper that we’re taking one of our premium picks as the number one candidate for the armband. This game sees the current top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£11.4m) facing the league’s worst defense, in a home game, after a 5-1 beating by Liverpool a few days earlier. What better way to get over such a harsh reality check than by banging in a bunch of goals against Fulham? It might also be worth mentioning that Auba has scored 11 of 13 goals so far against teams not currently in the top six. After his almost invisible game against the Reds last weekend, some managers have already decided to transfer him out, but they’re likely to be regretting that decision after coming Tuesday’s game. If you have Auba, you should captain him.Our second captaincy suggestion this week is Tottenham’s Son Heung-Min (£8.8m), because he’s in incredible form and we’ll have to do without him for a while soon. He produced the assist for Kane’s wonderful 1-0 and had another four shots at goal himself. On top of that, the Korean gave three key passes that led to danger in front of the Wolves goal, making him the most threatening man on the pitch. Opponents Cardiff kept a nice clean sheet against Leicester in gameweek 20, but it should be noted that the Bluebirds did so while allowing for no less than 31 attempts on goal, 22 of which came from inside the penalty area. With Son in red hot form and with Kane always ready to pounce, it looks like Cardiff, who have conceded 20 goals in 10 home matches in total, could be in trouble against Spurs on Tuesday.You can also see what fiso members think of their GW21 Captain in our weekly forum poll where  over 100 votes have already been cast giving Hazard a commanding 46% of the votes followed by Aubameyang on 23%, Kane 14% and Pogba 12%.“Leicester handed reigning
champions Man City a second consecutive defeat in gameweek 19” (CC by 2.0) by CFCUnofficialFPL Season 2018/19Gameweek 20 PreviewGameweek 19 was another high-scoring weekend overall, with an average score of 59 and plenty of managers scoring well over 70 points. There were no less than six players with a score of 15 FPL points or more, with surprise of the weekend Kyle Walker-Peters bringing home an incredible 18 points, courtesy of 3 assists, a clean sheet, and 3 bonus points. The other top scorers were Everton left-back Lucas Digne (17 points), Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren (15), West Ham winger Felipe Anderson (15), United midfielder Paul Pogba (15) and Chelsea superstar Eden Hazard (15). With just three days of rest between gameweek 19 and gameweek 20, the nightmare of player rotation is still far from finished, so keep that in mind when planning your transfers for this weekend.We’d also like to
remind all managers who haven’t used their first wildcard yet that they have
until the gameweek 20 deadline (December 29th, 2PM GMT) to do so.Some observations
ahead of gameweek 20Manchester United players are on the rise, in FPL terms at least. Sure, the two games under OGS saw the Red Devils face Cardiff away and Huddersfield at Old Trafford, two must-win games for any United manager, but the Norwegian’s winning start represents more than just the results. In a very short time, he’s managed to bring back some optimism to the red side of Manchester, both on and off the pitch. It’s probably too early to speak of a resurgence, but the Mancunians are off to a good start under Solskjaer. They are playing more attacking, free-flowing football, and a lot of the alleged discontent among the players seems to have evaporated. With home games against Bournemouth, Brighton, and Burnley coming up in the next five weeks, it’d be wise to check out the United roster for your future transfers.Speaking of clubs on the rise, Leicester City can’t remain unmentioned. Claude Puel, who was allegedly on the brink of being fired as boss of the Foxes not so long ago, saw his men book two impressive victories in the space of just a few days. Leicester first beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge (0-1) in gameweek 18 and then gave Pep Guardiola something to think about by beating his Man City 2-1 at the King Power. Next up are Cardiff at home, which is a challenge of a whole other type and it will be interesting to see how Leicester will handle having to take the initiative. In any case, confidence is soaring at Leicester and a third consecutive victory would see the Foxes start 2019 as the Premier League’s number seven.One of the most interesting games of the 20th gameweek is taking place in Southampton on Sunday, when the local FC are hosting Man City. In their third game under new manager Ralph Hasenhüttl, the Saints lost for the first time (1-2 to in-form West Ham and Felipe Anderson), while City saw their title hopes dented after back-to-back defeats (to Crystal Palace and Leicester). The hosts will have been disappointed with the loss against the Hammers, but they’ve shown great improvement since Hasenhütll was appointed. The confidence and positivity are coming back to the club, and they’ll be more than motivated to show it against a struggling City side. The Cityzens should normally win this game, but if they turn up giving anything less than 100%, the reigning champions could be plunged into a full-blown Christmas crisis by a revived Saints side.Finally, the
Premier League’s current bottom-ranked team, Huddersfield. Over the past twenty
years, there have been only 12 teams with less than 12 points after Boxing Day,
and of those 12 teams, 8 ended the season as last. The Terriers currently have
10 points (from 19 games), with the only “positive” being that Fulham and
Burnley just have 1 and 2 points more, respectively. Huddersfield, though, are
facing Fulham (19th, away), Burnley (18th, at home), and
Cardiff (17th, away) in the coming three gameweeks. This makes the
post-Christmas period probably the most crucial period for the Terriers this
season and they’ll need to make it count if they don’t want their season to be
scarily close to over by the end of next month.Premium picksBy scoring both of
Chelsea’s goals in their 1-2 victory over Watford, Eden Hazard (£11.0m) booked his second double-digit score in the last three
gameweeks. As a matter of fact, Hazard has been directly involved in 19 goals
this season, while having played just 18 games. Against the Hornets, the
Belgian didn’t only score twice, he also had three shots on target and created
another two big chances for his team mates. He has brought his owners more
hauls of 10 points or more (6) than any other player in the official game and
there have only been five Premier League games so far in which he hasn’t posted
an attacking return. The Chelsea star man is one of the most in-form players at
the moment and one of the best players in the world, and an away game against
an admittedly stubborn Palace side could mean another successful week for him.Our second premium pick of the week is a player we probably
should’ve mentioned a few weeks earlier, namely Tottenham’s Korean superstar Son
Heung-Min (£8.7m). The lightning-quick forward has been in good form since
gameweek 13, but in absolutely sensational form since gameweek 16. In his last
four Premier League games, Son has scored five goals and provided 3 assists,
with 49 FPL points as a result. Mind you, he played just 15 minutes in gameweek
17 and recorded just a single point that week. The Spurs attack is running at
full speed as of late, scoring 11 goals in their last 2 games, and Son has been
instrumental to Pocchetino’s plans. Of course, the Korean will be leaving for
the Asian Cup after gameweek 22, but this could have an upside as well.
Considering the form he’s in, he’s unlikely to be rested for the games in
gameweeks 20 (Wolves at home), 21 (Cardiff away), and 22 (United at home), so
if you can plan for his replacement in a few weeks time, you should probably
bring him in as soon as you can.This week’s final premium pick, at least
in terms of price, is also a bit of a punt, but hear us out. Liverpool’s Roberto
Firmino (£9.1m) is a crucial part of Jurgen Klopp’s hard-to-defend tactical
plan, but his new, deeper role has not done his FPL performances any favours.
The versatile Brazilian has scored 4 goals and given 5 assists so far this
season, with 77 FPL points as a result. He has blanked in his last three games
though,  a run that consisted of home
games against United and Newcastle, and an away game versus Wolves, so it takes
a bit of guts to bring him in for the home game against Arsenal. The Gunners
have conceded 16 goals in 9 away games already and are now going through
something of an injury crisis in terms of defenders, with Bellerin, Mustafi,
Monreal, Holding, Koscielny, and Mavrapanos all either injured or doubtful for
Saturday’s clash. The weak spot of the London outfit lies in the centre of
their defensive block and Firmino could well be capitalising on that, in
support of Mo Salah and Sadio Mané.A differential or twoTo call Kevin de Bruyne (£9.7m) a differential player is quite frankly a bit ridiculous, but his ownership stands at 4.2%, so selecting him would be a true differential choice, in theory. Of course, the Belgian has had a very unfortunate season, having played just 193 Premier League minutes so far due to ongoing injury concerns, but he’s arguably Pep Guardiola’s most key player. The Belgian playmaker is now officially injury-free and we expect him to be starting the coming games as City will be aiming to get back to winning ways after a very disappointing Christmas period. On Sunday, they’re visiting a Southampton side who have conceded four goals in the last three games (the first three under Ralph Hasenhüttl). A more worrying stat for the Saints though, is that they’ve allowed 16 goal attempts against both West Ham (last gameweek) and Huddersfield (in gameweek 18), the league’s least effective attack. City are struggling, but this game could be the perfect way to put those struggles behind them, and if they do, KDB could be decisive.Our other differential pick for gameweek
20 is Fulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic (£6.7m). Yes, the Serbian hitman
hasn’t scored since his two goals against Southampton in gameweek 13, but that
doesn’t paint the whole picture. In last weekend’s game against Wolves at
Craven Cottage, Mitro was one of the best players on the pitch. He made 8
attempts at goal, 3 of which were on target, while also providing a key pass.
He missed a Cyrus Christie centre by a few inches and he saw a ball cleared just
off the line by Wolves defender Ryan Bennett at the very end of the game. The
Fulham number nine was definitely the most threatening man on the pitch and it
wouldn’t be surprising if he finally finds the net again in a home game against
Huddersfield coming Saturday. The Terriers have conceded a worrying 20 goals in
9 away games.The captaincyIn theory, Harry Kane (£12.5m) is a
captaincy candidate every gameweek, as a result of being one of the best
strikers in the world. Add to that the fact that Spurs are in red hot
goal-scoring form and have a home game coming up, and the English striker
becomes a prime candidate for the armband in gameweek 20. True, the opposition
on Saturday are Wolves, who have conceded just 9 goals in 9 away games this
season, but it’s still hard to see Kane not getting some attacking returns
against them. He’s scored 4 goals and provided 3 assists in his last five
Premier League games, while also creating 5 big chances over that same period
of time. Tottenham’s very own has blanked in just two of his last nine games
(one of those appearances was a 16-minute cameo) and he’s just one goal behind
current top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Our second suggestion of the captaincy this week is Man United’s born-again Paul Pogba (£8.0m). When caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer arrived in Manchester, he said that Pogba would be central to his plans for the team and he didn’t exaggerate one bit. The Frenchman has taken on a central, more advanced role, with 3 assists and 2 goals in his last two games as a very tangible result. On top of that, he’s made 8 attempts at goal in those games, 5 off which were on target, and he gave 5 key passes. Sunday’s opponents Bournemouth have been leaking goals over the past few gameweeks, letting in 11 goals since round 16 and have just lost defender Simon Francis to a long-term injury. The Cherries have conceded 33 goals in total already this season, 19 of which in away games, so a reinvigorated United with the desire to attack in front of their own crowd is likely to be (way) too much for them.You can also see what fiso members think of their GW20 Captain in our weekly forum poll where Kane is currently leading the way with 44 of the 114 votes cast so far.The Telegraph Fantasy Football (TFF) Leaderboard  was shaken up on Boxing Day with Lee Turner’s leading team dropping down to 6th and Paul Ferguson’s Qwertyuiop team aptly taking over at the top of the ‘key’ board on 1,195 points. Long-term Fantasy Football players such as Stephen Buckley in 2nd, David Browne in 4th and Neil Carrington in 9th (who won the now defunct TFFO in 2005/06, 5 years after yours truly) are close at hand. Will TFF again be won by a FISO member (as it has for at least the last 3 years)?Now we take a look at the TFF Matches coming up over the next two days. Bear in mind the Xmas schedule is very hectic and Club Managers may feel some players need a rest.  For more news on TFF check out fiso’s TFF forum.Saturday 29th DecemberBrighton & Hove Albion 15:00 EvertonNo early fixture this Saturday so straight into the 3 o’clocks, the first of which has Everton travelling to the South Coast to take on Brighton. Everton got a fantastic win in midweek with the usual suspects of Siggy and Richarlison getting a goal each. Keep an eye on Digne too. Brighton got a respectable draw against the Gunners. Glenn Murray hasn’t scored for a couple of games, Dunk and Duffy are finally reunited and Ryan has now gone off to the Asian Cup.Fulham 15:00 Huddersfield TownA real six-pointer down at Craven Cottage where Uddersfield are the visitors. Uddersfield haven’t won for an absolute age and it is games like this that can make or break your season. Fulham have a couple of draws under their belts in December and would love to sign 2018 off with a win. Tricky one to call this as there is little quality in either of these sides.Leicester City 15:00 Cardiff CityThe all-conquering Foxes are next up. The Welsh Wizards from Wales are today’s visitors to the King Power. Cardiff are still just outside the bottom three but appear to be better at home than on the road and with Leicester being in good form having recently beaten Man City and Chelsea this has home win written all over it. Maddison is up to 7th overall on the best value for money TFF players with a return of 25 points per £m and Pereira is up to 12th after his goal against Man City took him up to 23.2 points per £m.Tottenham Hotspur 15:00 Wolverhampton WanderersWe are on our way to Wembley (again) where Spurs are taking on Wolves. Tottenham are another of the form teams in the Prem and have snuck up into second place thanks to Harry blowing the doors off on a regular basis. Wolves are still ticking along nicely but will probably end up second best today. Son has NOT gone off to the Asia Cup yet.Watford 15:00 Newcastle UnitedThe Watford rollercoaster might just be about to be heading downwards again as they lost last time out against Chelsea, however Newcastle are a different kettle of fish, so the Hornets could simply have hit a temporary bump in the track. Newcastle were unsurprisingly thrashed by Liverpool on Boxing Day and have settled into a lower-mid-table/upper-low-table position.Liverpool 17:30 ArsenalSaturday’s late match feature top of the table Liverpool versus fifth-placed Arsenal. Liverpool are flying high this season, Salah is in good form (now the top TFF points scorer on 118 points) and even with a patched-up defence Liverpool have progressed well over the Christmas period (Robertson, van Dijk and Alisson all in the top 10 overall TFF points scorers so far with 100+ points and in the top 6 best value for money TFF players). Arsenal have stalled a little of late, will still be missing Mkhitaryan due to injury and a defeat today could see them becoming detached from the top 4. Aubameyang is in good form though.Sunday 30th DecemberCrystal Palace 12:00 ChelseaCor blimey, Mary Poppins – it’s a London derby! Sunday’s early fixture sees Chelsea travel the short distance to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace. Chelsea have suffered a couple of defeats recently, but Hazard is in good form and they still sit inside the top four. Pedro is out injured for about 2 weeks with a hamstring problem. Crystal Palace are currently sat in lower mid-table, and Wilf ‘The Talisman’ Zaha isn’t in great form.Burnley 14:15 West Ham UnitedThe first of the 14:15 (I repeat, 14:15) matches is Burnley against West Ham. Burnley have been rooted in the bottom three for the majority of the season – what a difference a year makes. West Ham are comfortably sat in mid-table mediocrity but have some quality players in their squad, especially a Mr F Anderson Esq. who scored a couple against the Saints recently. Will Hernandez be fit for this one?Southampton 14:15 Manchester CityThe second of the 14:15s sees a slightly improved Southampton side taking on a Man City side who are in a bit of a slump at the moment. City have a few players back from injury (Dave Silva, De Bruyne, Aguero) so will be hoping for an improved performance today. Southampton have been revitalised since David “the rabbit hutch” Hasselhoff has been in charge though lost against the Hammers last time out in what only seems like last night (well it was last night!). Sterling seems to have gone off the boil but is still the 2nd highest TFF points scorer on 114 points.Manchester United 16:30 AFC BournemouthAnd finally, the final Premier League match of 2018 sees OGS’s Manchester United hosting Bournemouth at Old Trafford. Solskjaer has certainly rung the changes since he took over, perhaps not in personnel but in moral. Bournemouth had an excellent start to the season but their form has tailed off since and are now in the bottom half of the table and have also just lost defender Simon Francis to a long-term injury. Will Wilson find his shooting boots again soon – he’s fallen just outside the top overall TFF points scorers but still has accumulated 100 points? Will Pogba again prove to Mourinho that he should have played him in every match?Telegraph Fantasy Football (TFF) gets back into action tonight with Lee Turner’s team Wanaker FC still leading the way overall on 1,128 points. Below is a preview of the games over the next 2 days. For more news on TFF check out fiso’s TFF forum.WEDNESDAY 26TH DECEMBERFulham 12:30 WolvesBoxing Day’s early match sees a clash between two teams that this time last year were still in the Championship. Fulham are looking like they might be back there next year as they currently lie at the foot of the table. Wolves are just in the top ten and are probably favourites today.Burnley 15:00 EvertonThe first of the 3pm games features lowly Burnley against a mid-table Everton team who have the dynamic duo of Richarlison and Siggy (featuring his spiders). If Burnley want to stay up they will need to turn Turf Moor back into a fortress.Crystal Palace 15:00 CardiffPalace caused one the shocks of the weekend by beating Man City on their own turf, Zaha is off the boil but Milivojevic is in fine form. Cardiff on the other hand were drubbed by Man Utd. Therefore this should be a comfortable win for Crystal Palace.Leicester 15:00 Man CityThe Foxes are coming into this game off the back of a shock win against Chelsea, a Jamie Vardy winner no less. City themselves suffered a shock home defeat against Palace (see above). Pep’s men will be looking for nothing less than a win today.Liverpool 15:00 NewcastleTop of the table Liverpool welcome Newcastle to Anfield. Liverpool are the current form team in the division and ex-boss Rafa will probably be looking at damage limitation today. Will Klippety be doing a bit of squad rotation bearing in mind fixtures come think and fast at this time of year?Man Utd 15:00 HuddersfieldOGS looks to have revitalised a Manchester United side that were frankly failing under Jose. Uddersfield have been poor this season and will need to be in top form today to get anything from this game. Expect United to be rampant again.Tottenham 15:00 BournemouthSpurs are still playing their home games at Wembley and today Bournemouth are the visitors. Alli went off at half-time on Sunday and could be a doubt for today. Luckily Kane continues to blow the doors off though. Bournemouth rested Fraser last time out but Brooks has stepped up recently.Brighton 17:15 ArsenalThe late afternoon fixture has Arsenal travelling back down to the South Coast, this time to take on Brighton at the Am Ex. Arsenal were one of the few top-six teams to win at the weekend with Aubameyang in good form although Henrik Mkhitaryan is out for up to 6 weeks with a broken foot. Brighton meanwhile lost out to Bournemouth.Watford 19:30 ChelseaThe evening match features the Watford rollercoaster against Chelsea. Watford had a surprising victory away to the Hammers on Saturday. Chelsea lost at home to Leicester. Hazard is probably still the standout player in this one.THURSDAY 27TH DECEMBERSouthampton 19:45 West HamThe solitary Thursday game features a revitalised Southampton team, now managed by David Hasselhoff, taking on a visiting West Ham team that were rocked at the weekend by a defeat to Watford. On paper the Hammers should win, but this game is played on grass not paper!“Andros Townsend scored what could be the goal of
the year against Man City in gameweek 18” (CC by 2.0)
by Hayden SchiffFor the first time in quite a while,
all of the top captaincy choices performed in a gameweek. Mo Salah got 12 points
for his goal and assist versus Wolves to make him the highest scorer in FPL
again (125 points), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit the net twice against Burnley
to bring home 13 points for his owners, and Tottenham’s very own Harry Kane had
a 15-point haul after scoring two goals and providing an assist to 21-point man
Heung-Min Son.For the FPL managers who put their eggs in a Chelsea or City basket though, last weekend was something of a disaster. Chelsea went down 0-1 to Leicester at Stamford Bridge, while reigning champions City suffered a shock defeat at home to Crystal Palace (2-3). Premium assets and popular captaincy options like Raheem Sterling, Eden Hazard, and Leroy Sané all blanked, causing a lot of unexpected red arrows across the board. With leaders Liverpool, in-form Spurs, and a seemingly reinvigorated Man United all playing at home and facing interesting opposition, gameweek 20 will provide plenty of opportunities for points and green arrows.Some observations
ahead of gameweek 19Whether or not Man United would’ve disposed as easily of Cardiff as they did with Mourinho still in charge, we’ll never know. What we do know, is that the Red Devils booked a morale-boosting 1-5 away victory, with Rashford, Martial and Pogba all starting and with Jesse Lingard excelling by scoring two goals and assisting another. New manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a United legend who, besides spending eleven years at the club, also managed a few of United’s current stars when they were still rising through the club’s youth systems, among them Lingard and Pogba. The Norwegian’s tenure at United is just one game old, so we should take some time before labelling him the miracle doctor, but what’s true is that he’s off to a great start and the upcoming home game against Huddersfield provides a great opportunity to make it two for two.Probably the biggest shock of the weekend, and possibly of the entire season, was Palace’s away victory over Manchester City. It looks like not even Pep Guardiola’s goal machine is completely immune to the savagery that is the Premier League’s festive December month, and the Eagles were willing to prove that. As usual, the Cityzens came out to attack and score goals, but Palace manage to avoid truly dangerous situations for most of the time. They were well-organised and “stubborn”, as City’s Fabian Delph put it, while City were wasteful and generally not as threatening as they normally are. By the time Kevin de Bruyne was brought on in minute 62, the City engine started to glow again, but Palace were 1-3 up already by then and boosted by an absolute Andros Townsend screamer. City will get back to winning ways, don’t worry, but last weekend’s game showed that they’re certainly not invincible.In Chelsea, another title candidate suffered a surprise defeat last weekend. Leicester visited last weekend and not only did the Foxes take the three points back to the East Midlands, they managed to do so with a clean sheet (0-1). Of course, Ben Chillwel was excellent again at left-back and Jamie Vardy poached the only goal of the game, but it was especially the way in which Claude Puel’s men largely neutralised Chelsea’s star Eden Hazard that will have grabbed the attention of Chelsea’s future opponents. Blue’s manager Sarri has a lot of talent at his disposal, but it seems that when Hazard is not able to shine, neither is Chelsea. Considering the Leicester game represented Chelsea’s third loss in six games, the club will certainly be looking for ways to diminish the pressure that rests on the brilliant Belgian’s shoulders, possibly even during the winter transfer window.In the bottom half of the table,
Southampton seems to have started something of a surge up the ranks as new
manager Ralph Hasenhüttl’s men booked a second victory under the Austrian
coach, and their third Premier League victory all season. After their
impressive home victory against Arsenal, the Saints booked a 1-3 away victory
over Huddersfield that moved them out of the relegation zone and into 16th
place. Danny Ings once again led the Southampton attack and scored his third
goal over the past two gameweeks, this time from the penalty spot after winning
the spotkick himself. The Saints have a few difficult games coming up over the
coming three gameweeks, including a home game against City and an away game
versus Chelsea, but their roster nonetheless holds some interesting
differential potential.Premium picksAfter scoring a double and providing an assist away to Everton, Harry Kane (£12.5m) looks likely to be among the attacking returns again against Bournemouth at home in gameweek 19. As a matter of fact, the Spurs striker has returned in seven of his last eight Premier League games, scoring 6 goals and giving 4 assists. The only time Kane didn’t perform for his FPL managers, was in gameweek 16 against Leicester after he was brought on towards the end of the second half. Bournemouth have lost 5 of their 8 games on the road and they’ve conceded 14 goals in the process. Mauricio Pocchetino, on the other hand, had led Spurs to their best ever start to the Premier League after beating Everton 2-6 last weekend. The Spurs have won 5 of their 7 home games this season, a run in which they have scored 12 goals and conceded just 6. Just three of Kane’s eleven goals so far have come away from Wembley, but the Englishman is still one of the favourites to score this coming Wednesday.In a fashion reminiscent of last season, Liverpool’s Mo Salah (£13.2m) is rapidly becoming an unavoidable premium pick. The Egyptian forward was brilliant at Molineux last weekend, scoring the opener in the 18th minute and the providing the assist for Virgil van Dijk’s 0-2 in the second half. This made it four goals and two assists for Salah since gameweek 15, a run that has brought the happy 38.3% of FPL managers that own him an impressive 39 points, or an average of practically 10 points per game. Next up at Anfield is Newcastle, who have been in OK form as of late and who have shipped just 7 goals in 8 away games all season. Liverpool is flying though, and the Reds have scored 18 goals in just 8 home games already this season. Another Salah hat-trick, anyone?Our final premium pick of the week is another Liverpool player, namely Virgil van Dijk (£6.3m). The Dutch central defender has given Liverpool the defensive solidity that last year’s Liverpool missed at times, while he also chips in with the occasional attacking return from set-pieces. This was the case last weekend, when Virgil slotted home a Salah center, scoring his first goal of the season and adding to his two assists. In all honesty, his goal last weekend has caused somewhat of a hype around the centre back as he booked a 15-point haul, but we’re recommending him for his clean sheet potential, in the first place. Liverpool boasts the best defence in the league, by far, having conceded just 7 goals in 18 games so far. In other words, Newcastle, who have scored 7 goals in 8 away game, don’t look like they’ll be worrying the Liverpool defence too much on Wednesday.A
differential or twoBefore Southampton host
Man City and travel to Stamford Bridge, the Saints are playing a home game
against West Ham. While the Hammers have had an excellent December month so
far, their defensive solidity remains doubtful. They have shipped 11 goals in 8
away games and reborn in-form Saints striker Danny Ings (£5.6m) looks
like the most likely suspect to capitalise on West Ham’s defensive fragility.
The English number nine has welcomed new Saints coach Ralph Hasenhüttl in
style, with 3 goals in his last two games, including a double strike against
Arsenal. His ownership is rising, but still stands at 6.8% overall, making him
a great differential for the third (or even second) striker position in your
squad.The second differential pick of the week is Man United’s Marcus Rashford (£7.0m). True, it was the cheaper midfielder Jesse Lingard who took the spotlight last weekend (2 goals, 1 assist, 18 FPL points) and it was Paul Pogba who registered no less than three assists, but it was Rashford who took most shots at goal (4, as many as Lingard and Martial combined). In the continued absence of Romelu Lukaku as a result of private circumstances, Rashford is likely to start up front against Huddersfield at Old Trafford on Wednesday. It’s way too early to call United’s saviour on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but the positivity seems to have returned at United and Rashford (overall ownership 13.7%) could prove to be an excellent differential pick in gameweek 19.For further ideas check out the fiso forum FPL GW19 transfers topic.The
captaincySeeing as we already
recommended Harry Kane as a premium pick for gameweek 19, we’re recommending
his team mate Christian Eriksen (£9.2m) as a candidate for the armband.
With the Danish playmaker on the pitch, Tottenham are a better team, it’s that
simple. With Son and Kane taking up most of the attention lately, and with Dele
Alli chipping in with great attacking performances as well, Eriksen has been
operating somewhat in the background. Still, he has scored a goal in each of
his last two Premier League games, against Burnley and Everton, while he has
also provided four assists over the past six gameweeks. The risk with the Dane
is that he could be used in a too deep position by Pocchetino at times, which
reduces his goal threat, but he’s Spurs’ best player and a very likely starter
after having his minutes managed during the Champions League group stage.We’ve said before that recommending Mo Salah (£13.2m) is quickly becoming unavoidable and the same goes for handing him the armband. Should you have Salah in your team already, or if you’re bringing him in this week, he should probably be captained. If you don’t have him in your team and you’re not planning to bring him, all you can do is hope that he won’t produce a 21-point haul against Newcastle at home this week. Salah has scored 11 goals already this season and he’s set up another 6 goals, which has resulted in 125 FPL points so far. No player in the game has more. He’s scored 6 goals and given 2 assists in his last six Premier League games, a run that includes a 25-minute appearance in gameweek 15 (1 assist). Considering everything, there’s a big chance Salah will be the most-selected captain in the run-up to gameweek 19.According to the fiso forum members, the FPL GW19 Poll currently has Salah leading the way with 42% of the vote followed closely by Kane with 34%.Telegraph Fantasy Football (TFF) gets back into action tonight with Lee Turner’s team Wanaker FC leading the way overall on 1,072 points. Familiar names (such as Neil Carrington 3rd and David Browne 9th) are hot on his heels. Has Lee saved enough transfers from his budget of 40 to hold off the challengers particularly when the FA Cup action involving the EPL clubs starts? Below is a preview of the games over the next 3 days. For more news on TFF check out fiso’s TFF forum.FRIDAY 21ST DECEMBERWolves 20:00 LiverpoolTo start us off this week is that rare beast, the Friday Night Fixture. This time around it features Table topping Liverpool visiting Molineux to take on an over-achieving Wolves side who boast Matt Doherty in their side who is the player with the most points per £m in TFF at 26.6 (based on 77 points for his £2.9m cost) i.e. the best budget-enabler to have in your team! Wolves’ striker Jimenez also has provided a great return with 20.5 points per £m spent but he’s playing against a defence that should have Robertson (25.8 per £m), Allison (23.5 per £m) and van Dijk (20.7 per £m) who are all in the top 10 best value for money players. Liverpool have yet to lose in the League but it’s games like this that see records broken. Van Dijk, Salah and Robertson have scored 43, 41 and 41 TFF points respectively in the last 6 weeks (putting them comfortably inside the top 10 for that form period).SATURDAY 22ND DECEMBERArsenal 12:30 BurnleySaturday’s early match features a relegation threatened Burnley team taking on an Arsenal side coming off of the back of a couple of rare defeats. Mkhitaryan scored a brace for the Gunners last weekend but there’s no guarantee he’ll start today as he hobbled off in midweek. There’s a little uncertainty of who’s going to lead the line for Arsenal or whether both Aubameyang (91 TFF points which is 7th overall) and Lacazette (76 TFF points in 20th overall) might play together.Bournemouth 15:00 BrightonThe seaside derby is the first of our 3 o’clocks, featuring the resort towns of Bournemouth versus Brighton and Hove. The Cherries and not in the best of form at the moment although Callum Wilson may well be back as the main striker and he’s the surprise striking package of the year mustering 96 TFF points putting him in 6th overall having recently been the 2nd highest overall. Brighton have got back to winning away ways of late though so there’s a chance of a Seagulls win.Chelsea 15:00 LeicesterDown at the Bridge, Chelsea welcome a Leicester team who are in very poor form. Chelsea will be hoping to cement a top four place today and stay in touch with the leading pair. Alonso and Hazard continue to lead the way for Chelsea in TFF accumulating 98 and 97 TFF points respectively for the season so far. Leicester rested a lot of first teamers for the midweek Cup loss, will this have been the right thing to do?Huddersfield 15:00 SouthamptonA real six pointer next, where 19th plays 17th but there is only a couple of points between the two teams. Uddersfield haven’t picked up a single point in December, always losing by a single goal. The Saints now have ‘David Hasselhoff’ in charge and have recently recorded a victory against Arsenal thanks to a brace by Ings.Man City 15:00 Crystal PalaceCrystal Palace are this week’s visitors to the Ethiad where they will take on second place Manchester City. You know when Christmas is here when Jesus gets a brace (he was a carpenter after all). Sterling and Sane lead the way on form with the most TFF points in the last 6 weeks (57 and 54 points respectively) and Sterling is also the only player with more than 100 TFF points for the season. Kevin de Bruyne may get more game time after his recent injuries. Palace have Zaha back for this one after last weekend’s suspension.Newcastle 15:00 FulhamFulham are away to the lads of Newcastle this weekend. Fulham are rock bottom with a poor goal difference so even a win today would leave them at the foot of the table. Rondon appears to have rediscovered his goal scoring boots for Newcastle and is up to 15th in the TFF form table based on 36 TFF points in the last 6 weeks but Newcastle will be playing the likes of Liverpool (Away), Man Utd (Home), Chelsea (Away), Man City (Home) and Spurs (Away) between now and 2nd Feb so think twice if jumping on to that bandwagon.West Ham 15:00 WatfordWell, well, well – it’s West Ham v Watford in the last of the 3 o’clock kick-offs. West Ham have put their shaky start behind them and are not missing the injured Arnautovic thanks to a little pea and Felip Anderson who is the 3rd highest form TFF points scorer based on the last 6 weeks (50 points). Watford’s rollercoaster is currently on the up so expect a thrilling game today with maybe Pererya increasing his budget midfielder credence (thanks to his current 23.3 TFF points per £m which puts him 4th overall and the best value for money midfielder in TFF).Cardiff 17:30 Man UtdSaturday’s late fixture sees Manchester United travelling to the Cardiff Stadium in Cardiff to take on Cardiff. The Welsh Wizards from Wales have started to find their feet and have picked up a few points recently. The United of old would expect an easy win, their latest incarnation will be hoping not to lose! Perhaps a super-sub will score the winner? TFF Managers are discussion on the fiso forum taking a punt on Man Utd players (like Pogba who will have a point to prove) to help them climb up the leaderboard.SUNDAY 23RD DECEMBEREverton 16:00 TottenhamAnd finally, the Sunday afternoon fixture has Spurs travelling to Goodison to play Everton. Tottenham snuck past Burnley last weekend in a dire match but had a good win against the Gunners in the Cup. Spurs have Kane who is only in 11th overall on the overall TFF points scoring charts with 84. Everton will be looking to Richarlison or Siggy to score the goals to cause an upset today.XMAS SCHEDULEFinally, a quick note on the clubs’ hefty Christmas schedule. As you can see from the image below, of the top clubs, Tottenham have the most demanding schedule – playing their four matches within the space of 10 days. In contrast, Liverpool and Manchester City have the most recovery time, 14 and 13 days respectively.
Full analysis of all EPL clubs here.You may not be that familiar with fantasy sports but have always been intrigued by it. In fact, it’s one of those activities that many people find quite interesting and challenging. There are a few good reasons as to why you might consider getting more involved with it going forward.It’s important to remain open-minded as you try to determine if it’s the right activity for you. If you have a naturally competitive nature about you, then this could be just what you need to keep yourself occupied in your free time. You won’t know just how successful you can be or if it’s a good fit until you give it a try.1. Combats BoredomOne main reason to attempt getting more involved with fantasy sports is that it combats boredom. Maybe you’re someone who has a lot of extra time on their hands and isn’t sure how to best spend it. This type of activity requires specific background knowledge and your full attention, so you’ll likely feel very engaged right off the bat. No longer will you be looking for ways to fill your schedule once you pick this up as a side hobby. The better you get at it, the more time you’ll likely invest in participating in fantasy sports, and the less time you’ll have to feel bored.2. Way to Learn More about Sports, Teams & PlayersAnother reason as to why you might want to try fantasy sports is that it’s a way for you to learn more about sports, teams and individual players. For example, you can even take it a step further as you get more knowledgeable and give Unibet Horse Betting a go and you’ll quickly start to become an expert in this area.

There are online forums, and it can promote healthy discussion globally with others who are also involved in fantasy sports. You can improve and enhance your knowledge through scouts, providing hints, tips and the latest news.Fantasy Sports may be a good fit if any of these benefits that come from doing so resonate with you. Remember that just like any hobby or activity that’s new to you, it may take you some time before you truly become skilled at it. It’s also a wise idea to dabble in a few different sports until you find the one where you’re able to consistently perform well when picking your teams and players.“Chelsea’s Eden Hazard shone in the 1-2 victory over Brighton last weekend, with an assist and a goal” (CC by 2.0) by Ben SutherlandEuropean football and the increased danger of rotation that comes with it may be on a break until February, but that doesn’t mean FPL managers get a break. The Premier League keeps powering through the festive December month and this week it was time for the League Cup quarter finals as well. As far as Premier League clubs are concerned, Man City eliminated Leicester after penalties on Tuesday night following a 1-1 draw with Kevin de Bruyne starting and scoring after 14 minutes and Aguero played for 76 minutes. On Wednesday night, Chelsea beat Bournemouth 1-0 (thanks to a Hazard goal after coming on as a 2nd half sub) and now face Tottenham (in a two leg semi-final) after their 2-0 win at the Emirates against Arsenal (Harry Kane came on in the 2nd half to provide the assist for Deli Alli’s goal, whilst Aubameyang played the full 90 minutes). These match-ups will inevitably have an impact on the starting line-ups for gameweek 18, so keep an eye on what happened in these League Cup matches.Some observations ahead of gameweek 18Some of the more attentive and risk-tolerant FPL managers out there will have noticed the rising appeal of Huddersfield players since last gameweek, at least in terms of their fixture calendar. Between rounds 18 and 22, the Terriers are facing Southampton at home, Fulham away, Burnley at home, and Cardiff away. Despite the fact Huddersfield have scored just 10 goals and brought home 10 points from 17 games, you could be forgiven for considering a few Huddersfield assets as differentials. If you do though, keep in mind that Huddersfield’s best player and creator-in-chief Aaron Mooy will be out until February, which is more than likely going to affect their productivity in front of goal. And they are the least-scoring team already, by some distance.The shock result of gameweek 17 was Southampton’s home victory over Arsenal. In new manager’s Ralph Hasenhüttl’s first game at Saint Mary’s, the Saints were the team to end Arsenal’s 22-game unbeaten run. True, Arsenal’s defence is still a work in progress, but Southampton had won only once in 16 games before last weekend, a run in which they scored just 13 goals. Credit where credit’s due. It was only Hasenhüttl’s second game in charge, so it’s way too early still to judge the real impact he will have on the Saints squad. The first signs are promising though, and apart from Man City at home and Chelsea away in gameweeks 20 and 21, their fixtures look pretty interesting until February. Watchlist material.At Chelsea, Eden Hazard seems to be finding the form again that showed why he was the best player in the league at the start of the 2018-19 campaign. The talismanic forward has been deployed as a false-nine in the last two games (after Morata’s recent hamstring injury), which yielded a 2-0 victory over reigning champions Man City and a hard-fought away victory over Brighton last weekend. Against the champions, Hazard provided two assists, while he scored and assisted one against the Seagulls. The Belgian recently declared that he gets less time on the ball when playing all the way up front, but the role seems to fit him like a glove inside Maurizio Sarri’s preferred 4-3-3 formation.As a final point, we should probably mention José Mourinho‘s departure as Man United coach, despite the apparent inevitability of the decision since the start of the season, more or less. The final nail in the coffin was last weekend’s 3-1 loss to bitter rivals Liverpool. The result was bad, but always a possibility against the best Liverpool we’ve seen in many years. The real on-field problem was the uninspired, unattractive way in which the Portuguese manager had his Red Devils playing, again. Against Liverpool, they had 37% of the possession, resulting in 3 shots on target and 2 shots off target. The home team recorded 10 shots on target and 11 shots off target. With players like Rashford, Alexis Sanchez, Martial, Pogba, Matic and Lukaku, there is plenty of potential at United, and it’ll be up to former-United player and hero Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to bring the enjoyment and results back to old Trafford this season as interim manager.Premium picksWith Man City facing Crystal Palace at home in gameweek 18, our first premium pick of the week is City winger Leroy Sané (£9.7m). Not only is the young German one of the in-form players in Pep Guardiola’s team, but he was left out of the squad for Tuesday night’s League Cup game against Leicester. Though no algorithm in the world can predict which eleven players Pep will start coming Saturday, Sané has a good chance of appearing at the kick-off. He has 3 goals and 4 assists in his last five games, and he’ll be facing a Palace team who have conceded 15 goals in 9 away games. As a matter of fact, no midfielder in the FPL has recorded more goal involvements than Sané, and the match against Palace could very well result in his fourth double-digit haul of the season.The story of Eden Hazard (£11.0m) for gameweek 18 is somewhat similar to the reasons for including Sané in this list. Chelsea faced Bournemouth on Wednesday night in the League Cup quarter final round and Hazard was left out of the starting XI by Maurizio Sarri only then to come on in the 2nd half and score the winner. The Belgian dribbler was taken off with a slight injury in the 83rd minute last weekend, after scoring a goal and providing an assist for Pedro, but his coach assured the 34.8% of FPL managers who own Hazard that the injury was nothing serious as was proven last night. It’s highly likely that the Blues’ star man will be starting on Saturday at home to Leicester, possibly in the false-nine role that he’s been handed since gameweek 16. Hazard has provided four assists and a goal in his last four Premier League games, bringing home 33 FPL points and becoming the highest-scoring FPL asset in the process. He’s the player with the most attempted assists over the last four gameweeks (13) and another haul coming weekend is far from unthinkable.Our final premium pick for gameweek 18 is again, partly, related to this week’s League Cup encounters. Arsenal hosted Spurs on Wednesday night and to the surprise of many, it was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who led the front line in the derby, not Alexandre Lacazette (9.6m). The Frenchman has seen limited pitch-time over the past few weeks, playing no more than 45 minutes in any of the last four gameweeks. He still managed to record a goal and two assists in that period though, with 16 FPL points as result. Seeing as Lacazette played half an hour against Spurs in the League Cup while Aubameyang completed the full 90 minutes, it seems probably that manager Emery will be starting with the French striker against Burnley on Saturday. The Clarets have conceded an average of two goals per away game this season and the 10% of FPL managers who own Lacazette will be hoping for a goal or two.A differential or twoThis week’s first differential pick is a combination of a decent price-to-points ratio and a very attractive gameweek 18 fixture. Newcastle’s Solomon Rondón (5.8m) has scored 2 goals and provided 1 assist over the past three gameweeks, a run that consisted of a home game against Wolves and away games versus Everton and Huddersfield. Newcastle will be facing the league’s worst defence this weekend, with opponents Fulham having conceded a whopping 24 goals in 9 away games. Rondón has won his owners a total of 20 points over the past three gameweeks, which is an excellent return for a player with his price tag. He’s one of the best budget striker options in the English elite division right now and a legit captaincy option in gameweek 18 for the more risk-tolerant FPL managers among us.Mentioning Southampton’s Danny Ings (5.4m) as our second differential pick of the week can be seen as a case of wanting to jump on a bandwagon that’s not even a real bandwagon yet, but hear us out. New manager Ralph Hasenhüttl will need some time to make his mark on the Saints, but if the team’s performance against Arsenal was anything to go by, several Southampton assets could be rising in popularity over the coming weeks, Ings among them. The English striker missed four gameweeks through injury, but returned with a bang by scoring twice last weekend. As a matter of fact, he’s been directly involved in four goals in his last four Premier League games (3 goals, 1 assist), resulting in 25 points. At a price of £5.4m, with an ownership of just 4%, and an away game against Huddersfield this Saturday, Ings could be a very rewarding differential signing.For further inspiration, have a look at the fiso forum Gameweek 18 FPL Transfers topic.The captaincyWe’ve mentioned earlier that predicting Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up is close to impossible, but we’re still recommending a City player as a premium option for the captain’s armband coming weekend. Raheem Sterling (£11.6m) has been impressive so far this season, which is illustrated by his 9 goals and 7 goals in 1,135 Premier League minutes. To the disgust of the 21.8% of FPL managers who have the young Englishman in their team, he was left out of the starting line-up twice over the past three gameweeks, with the game in which he started (the defeat to Chelsea) resulting in just two points. On Tuesday, Sterling was brought on in the 66th minute to force a winner against Leicester in the League Cup, something that unfortunately didn’t happen. What did happen, was him sending a penalty over the bar during the game’s penalty shout-out. Considering his excellent form this season, he won’t be phased by this though and will be looking to make amends for that bad penalty miss. So on the contrary, he’s a prime candidate for a big haul against Palace this weekend and thus for the armband.Our final recommendation for gameweek 18 is Liverpool’s Sadio Mané (9.6m). While an away game against Wolves is no piece of cake this season, with the Wolves taking 14 points from 9 games at home, a great return for a newly-promoted team. The Reds are flying though, with them extending their stay at the top of the league for at least one week after taking care of arch rivals Man United at Anfield. Mané was a constant threat to the Red Devil backline and he scored the opening goal by converting a lovely Fabinho chip. In terms of FPL returns, the Senegalese powerhouse had been quiet since his two assists against Watford in gameweek 13, but his goal against United might be the start of a high-scoring run. It’s also interesting to know that Liverpool are the only club from the current top five to have had a full week of rest, as they are no longer in the League Cup. Jurgen Klopp will have a pumped up and fully-rested squad at his disposal for the game at Molineux, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see Mané’s name on the score sheet coming weekend.Don’t forget that the first match this GW18 is on Friday night and if you don’t like our two Captain suggestions have a look at the GW18 FPL Captain Poll on the fiso forum where currently Sterling has 48% of the vote, followed by Sane 15%, Aubameyang 13%, Salah 8% and Hazard 7%.“Last gameweek’s hattrick hero Mo Salah in action for Liverpool” (CC by 2.0) by Patrick StrandbergBar the happy 38.5% of FPL managers who had Liverpool’s Mo Salah in their teams for gameweek 16, the last round of Premier League football was one to forget for most. In FPL terms that is because, in non-Fantasy football terms, gameweek was more than exciting. Man City lost their unbeaten status to a Chelsea side that recovered admirably from the disheartening defeat against Wolves a few days earlier, which gave Liverpool the chance to go top of the league. After a period of 11 days in which we saw three gameweeks, thirty games, and a LOT of rotational heartache among FPL managers, most teams (apart from those playing in Europe this week) have a week to prepare for gameweek 17. The festivities continue…Some observations ahead of gameweek 17
During the week build-up to gameweek 17, the final rounds of the group stages in the Champions League will be played. On Tuesday night, both Spurs and Liverpool qualified for the knock-out stage by drawing away at Barcelona (with a late Lucas Moura goal after a cross from Harry Kane) and winning at home to Napoli (with a cheeky goal from that man Salah), respectively. On Wednesday night, Man City beat German side Hoffenheim 2-1 thanks to two excellent goals from Sane, while their red city rivals Man Utd are lost by the same score to a Valencia side in disarray and only scored in the last 10 minutes thanks to a Marcus Rashford header. Both teams had already qualified for the Champions League’s round of 16, but the battle for first place in the group was still on.This (Thursday) evening , Arsenal and Chelsea are playing their last games in the Europa League group stage. The situation for both of these teams is a bit different in comparison to that of their colleagues in the Champions League, as both teams have already secured a spot in the Europa League knock-out stage as the winners in their respective groups. Chelsea will be visiting Hungarian outfit Vidi FC, while Arsenal are welcoming Qarabag FK from Azerbaijan to the Emirates. Again, do keep an eye on how the London powerhouses line up for these games, but expect a considerable number of key players to be rested in preparation for gameweek 17 in the Prem.Despite lining up at home against Fulham last round, few people will have considered the game a shoe-in for Manchester United, especially when it was confirmed that star performer Anthony Martial would be missing the game. What followed though, was a more than decent display against an, admittedly, impotent Fulham, resulting in a 4-1 victory for the Red Devils. Marcus Rashford started on the right wing and repaid his manager’s faith in him with a goal and an assist and an overall impressive performance. From an FPL point of view though, the United squad remains something of a mixed bag, with Mourinho’s uncanny ability to seemingly cause dressing room disharmony wherever he goes. Paul Pogba, for example, remained on the bench for 90 minutes due to no other apparent reason than the manager’s choice.In London then, Chelsea hosted rampant reigning champions Man City. The Blues had suffered something of a shock defeat away to Wolves a round before that and hopes for something of a result against City were low. Coach Maurizio Sarri, who is known to tinker very little with his starting eleven, somewhat surprised us as he left Giroud on the bench and Morata at home in order to have Eden Hazard play in a false-nine position. Likewise Man City started without Aguero or Jesus up front. Sarri’s approach worked though, as the Blues went on to beat City 2-0, the first Premier League defeat for Pep Guardiola’s men this campaign. While City dominated large parts of the match particularly in the first half, Chelsea’s backline operated as one and the Blues attack was effective on the counter, with Hazard at the centre of almost everything. If this match has shown us anything, it’s that the 2018-19 title race could well be very tight until the very end.Premium picks
This gameweek, the Premier League’s top 3 are playing home games, so we’re selecting what we expect to be a main man in each of the encounters, starting with Man City’s Raheem Sterling (£11.6m). Despite playing 90 minutes and bringing in just two points for his owners in gameweek 16 when he played as the centre-forward against Chelsea, the young Englishman is primed to feature and shine against Everton this weekend. He wasn’t however rested against Hoffenheim on Wednesday night but he did sit out 90 minutes in gameweek 15, so he’ll hopefully be back to his usual, goalscoring ways on Saturday. Sterling’s 8 goals and 7 assists in the league so far make him the second-highest scoring player in FPL (106 points), just 5 points behind Mo Salah. Of course, rotation is always a risk when it comes to Guardiola, but Sterling hopefully will be a pretty safe bet.Spoiler alert: we’ll be recommending Harry Kane as one of our captaincy options for gameweek 17 a bit later on in this article, so we’re going with Christian Eriksen (£9.3m) for our second premium pick for this week. The reason we want to include both Spurs stars this week, is that they are hosting Burnley on Saturday. Mind you, that’s not last season’s rock-solid, hard-to-break-down Burnley, but this season’s Burnley who have scored just six goals in eight on the road while conceding 17. Five of their away games ended in defeat and no team in the elite division has allowed more shots per game than the Clarets (20.7 on average). Eriksen’s 23-minute cameo off the bench last gameweek was disappointing, but the Danish playmaker provided 4 assists and a total of 22 FPL points in the three games preceding gameweek 16. He did complete the intense 90 minutes at Camp Nou yesterday night, so there is a slight chance of rotation again, but it’s likely Pocchetino will start him against Burnley.Finally, current league leaders Liverpool are playing at home as well, though their guests are of a different calibre than Burnley or even Everton. The final game on Sunday will see Liverpool host bitter rivals Man United, which sounds more than promising. After his fantastic hat-trick away against in-form Bournemouth in gameweek 16 and his crucial goal in the 1-0 victory over Napoli on Tuesday night, there’s no getting around Mo Salah (£13.0m). The Egyptian wizard has been good all season, but it seems like he’s taken the festive period to work back to his record-beating best. He’s scored five goals and provided one assist over the last five gameweeks, bringing his total for the 2018-19 campaign to 10 goals and 5 assists in 16 games. His goal last night sent Liverpool through to the Champions League knock-out stage, while Chelsea’s victory over City in gameweek 16 meant that Liverpool took over from City as leaders in the league after beating Bournemouth 0-4 themselves. These are good times for Salah and Liverpool.A differential or two
There will have been a lot of sad faces as well as a few full-blown panic attacks among West Ham supporters when club talisman Marko Arnautovic announced he would be out injured for about a month after limping off in gameweek 15. Fortunately for the Hammers, Chicharito (£6.4m) stepped up immediately. The Mexican poacher already made the most of his first 90 minutes of Premier League football in gameweek 14 by scoring a brace against Newcastle, followed by a disappointing 2-pointer at home to Cardiff and a stellar performance versus Palace last gameweek (1 goal, 1 assist, 9 FPL points). He seems to thrive in Manuel Pellegrini’s preferred 4-4-2 formation, and with Fulham, Watford, and Southampton up next, Chicharito is bound to bag a few more goals.Up until a few days ago, we would have recommended Huddersfield’s Aaron Mooy as our second differential pick of the week, but the Australian playmaker unfortunately suffered an injury that will see him out of action for the foreseeable future. This is a considerable blow to David Wagner and his Huddersfield, for whom Mooy is often the best man on the pitch. Terriers fans will now be hoping that another one of their creative thinkers will step up and provide the much-needed supply up front. Alex Pritchard (£4.8m) is a nailed-on starter for David Wagner and the importance of his role in the team will only grow in the absence of Mooy. Huddersfield are, as we know by now, the least productive outfit in the Premier League in terms of goals, but their upcoming fixture list presents plenty of opportunities to improve on that front. With home games against Newcastle, Southampton, and Burnley coming up over the next six gameweeks, as well as away games versus Cardiff and Fulham, Pritchard might well prove to be a differential for those willing to take a punt. His 11 shots over the past four gameweeks rank him fourth among all midfielders in FPL, while upcoming opponent Newcastle are among the worst teams in the league when it comes to shots conceded (234).If you’d like to see more suggestions on who to bring into your team for GW17 then head over to the fiso forum’s GW17 transfers topic.The captaincy
As mentioned earlier, our first recommendation for the armband this week is Tottenham’s very own Harry Kane (£12.5m). At home to an out of sorts Burnley it’s hard to imagine Kane not getting on the score sheet. Only Fulham (40) have conceded more goals than Burnley (32) this season, while Spurs have scored 11 in 6 home games. As far as Kane goes, the English striker has had 27 shots on target, a total only equalled by Mo Salah, with just over half of his efforts ending up between the woodwork. His 16-minute cameo against Leicester in gameweek 16 was a kick to the gut for many FPL managers, but he recorded attacking returns five weeks in a row before that (4 goals, 2 assists, 36 FPL points). Harry played 90 minutes against Barcelona on Tuesday, providing the assist for Moura’s goal in the 85th minute, so there is a small chance his time might be managed against Burnley. Still, considering he was largely rested in gameweek 16, it’s probably safe to captain him this weekend.Our second captaincy pick for gameweek 17 is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£11.5m), who’ll be facing Southampton at Saint Mary’s on Sunday. Arsenal’s productivity at home against Huddersfield in gameweek 16 was disappointing, to say the least. Where many expected a goal bonanza, the Gunners struggled to break down the well-organised Terriers. The eventual only goal of the game fell in the 83rd minute, as good work by Aubameyang allowed for an acrobatic finish by Torreira. The Gabonese striker completed the 90 minutes against Huddersfield, but he’s expected to be rested for Arsenal’s home game against Qarabag FK on Thursday. Understandable, as his 10 goals and 4 assists in just 1210 minutes of Premier League football make him the highest-scoring striker in FPL at the moment (98 FPL points). Southampton has conceded 10 goals in seven home games, while Arsenal have been scoring more or less for fun in away games (18 goals in 7 games), so Aubameyang could be in for a big haul this weekend.Not surprisingly Harry Kane is leading the fiso forum GW17 Captain Poll with currently 72% of the vote. Aubameyang follows with 10%, Sterling 6% and Hazard 5%.Eyebrows were raised when West Ham United announced the signing of Felipe Anderson in a club record deal from Lazio. The £36 million transfer fee was huge was West Ham, but as we near the halfway stage of the season, it already appears to be a bargain.West Ham ended November with a 4-0 defeat at home to Manchester City a result which left them in 13th place in the Premier League and four points above the relegation zone. Felipe Anderson struggled to make an impact against the defending champions and West Ham fans may have been left wondering why they had paid so much for the Brazilian attacking midfielder.Their next game was away to Newcastle United and this time, Felipe Anderson was in fine form, producing multiple opportunities for the Hammers strikers as well as being on the end of some opportunities himself. Although he failed to produce an assist for one of his teammates, he did end up on the scoresheet, with a 93rd minute goal to give West Ham a 3-0 win over the Magpies at St James Park.
He was once again found wanting in the Hammers’ match against Cardiff, as the midfielder failed to make an assist or to score as West Ham ran out 3-1 winners against their Welsh opponents. He once again found his form in their most recent match against Crystal Palace, where he scored West Ham’s third goal in their 3-2 win against the Eagles.Another magic display from @F_Andersoon ? pic.twitter.com/Aj4FhLfyKU— West Ham United (@WestHamUtd) December 8, 2018Although Anderson has produced moments of magic for his new club, his lack of consistency might be a concern. West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has already admitted that he has his eyes firmly on the top six this season, with only five points separating West Ham in 11th with Manchester United in 6th. Felipe Anderson will be key to that charge towards the top six and as he gets more accustomed to the Premier League, who knows how good the Brazilian could become?As are the dreams for many clubs, the Champions League will be eyed up by both the club’s fans and hierarchy, especially with Premier League winning manager Manuel Pellegrini in charge. If West Ham are to have any hope of being involved in any future UEFA Champions League odds, the club will need to back the manager in the transfer market.West Ham have been unlucky with injuries over the past few seasons and they will be praying Anderson doesn’t fall victim to such a curse. Having almost taken over from Marko Arnautovic as the club’s most important player, any injury to him will severely damage the chances of West Ham reaching the top six.With six goals and one assist in the league for the Hammers’ this season, this could well be the start of something magical for the club. A player whose impact has already propelled the club up the table, more consistent performances from the Brazilian may end up with a transfer bid in the not so distant future." 49301.0 0.0 " | FISO – The World's Leading Fantasy Sports Community"

FlyingFishThis is a personal website containing a
few articles
and links, focused around the issues of the mass media, information,
power, democracy and quality of life.
It is dedicated to the
resistance
against news and image management, against the systematic distortion
and trivialisation of reality that mainstream culture spews forth.
To the extent that we know and
understand what's going on around us, we are empowered to make informed
and wise decisions about how we live and act. Most of us know or
understand next to nothing about the world around us; therefore, our
'freedom of choice' and our votes are next to worthless.
It is against the interests of big
business corporations, and of most politicians, that we be empowered.
The less informed and aware we are,
the more they are able to sell us their images, news, ideas and
products. None of these necessarily improve the quality of our lives;
indeed, they impoverish our lives, since a quality life is an empowered
life, and this is precisely what the corporate political establishment
strives to reserve for itself.











""Public opinion
itself is manufactured like other commodities; the proprietors of five
or six great newspapers control it with the same certainty as the
pointsman sends a train to the north or to the west. Ignorance has the
grievous result of making the mass of the people and the middle classes
a docile force in the hands of a few informed men. In the heart of our
seeming democracies it has permitted the formation of an oligarchy of
those who know.""

Delaisi, Oil: Its Influence on Politics (1922), p.5; translated
by C. Leonard Leese from the French, Le Pétrole (1920)

// ]]>-->Warwick Racing are a group of academic and extracurricular projects run by Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) and supported by the School of Engineering. Students studying engineering at the University of Warwick gain valuable practical and project management skills as part of this project.Warwick Racing are a student run racing team who design and build single seat race cars for participation at international competitions. In the past we have competed not only at the UK competitions, where we achieved 3rd Overall with 2nd in Design for Class 2 last year, but have travelled to Germany and even as far as Australia! Abroad, we competed against teams from all over the world and reached an international audience.This year the team are designing and manufacturing our first electric Formula Student vehicle. As the world trend moves more towards electric automobiles it is important that our next generation of engineers have hands on experience with electric powertrains.Warwick Racing are aiming to be the first ever UK University to design, manufacture and race an electric car at the Formula Student UK competition that completes all Dynamic events. Educating the next generation of engineers in electric vehicle technology and giving them the platform to innovate and create new technologies for the future.Since 2014, Warwick Racing has evolved to feature an extracurricular aspect, alongside the academic projects. The role of developing a car to compete in Formula Student has now become available to all Warwick students, allowing students of all degree streams and all years to take part. As a result of this our team has grown to more than 600 members, allowing them all to get involved in design, manufacture and testing our vehicles. Our newly founded business team has been a big attraction and has introduced marketing, sponsorship and finance roles to the team which have helped hugely in our rapid expansion.(function() {

Ancient stone walls whisper the history of this distinctively beautiful croft cottage. The calm and quirky interior refreshes and intrigues. A big picture window gives spectacular views of the seashore and wildlife immediately outside with amazing colourful sunsets and mountain views beyond.From the comfort of the armchair you can watch our local otter, the high tide lapping a few feet away.Privately situated on a tidal estuary full of wildlife, you couldn?t be closer to nature. In addition to otters there are seals, seabirds and waders. Eagles and buzzards soar above and herons stand like sentinels by the water's edge. The area is a designated site of scientific interest for its geology and there are giant fossils nearby with smaller ones in the walls of the cottage.At least 150 years old, Fossil Cottage is full of character and imagination, providing tasteful comfort with an ambience all of its own. No predictable furnishings and standardisation here, but everything you need for a perfect, exclusive holiday.Nearby along the estuary are beautiful sands, a hidden coral beach island, a fascinating old graveyard and an ancient wishing well.In spring sheep and lambs wait (or sometimes don?t wait) for the tide to go out to cross over to their moorland grazings. The sheep wade and lambs learn to swim only hours after being born.© 2017 Fossil Cottage | All rights reservedThanks to Martin Benson, Shirley Grant and Bob McMillan for their excellent photos" 50372.0 0.0 "Fossil Cottage - Home Page"

Prior's FlourThe home of stone-ground artisan flour ground by wind powerThe Prior’s Flour comprises a delicious range of stoneground organic flours milled by wind power at Fosters Mill, Swaffham Prior. Sourcing local, premium quality organic grain, master miller, Jonathan Cook crafts a range of artisan flours for the discerning professional and amateur baker.The flours are milled using horizontal French burr stones which preserve the natural nutrition and vitamin content of the grain. The flours are sold from the mill, by mail order and through a number of outlets in the Cambridgeshire area.Fosters Mill is over 160 years old and stands on a site where mills have worked since the times of Domesday. By purchasing our products, you are helping to safeguard this historic listed mill for future generations and keeping it doing the job for which it was intended – producing best quality artisan flours from local grain.Learn MoreVisit The MillWhere to BuyFor centuries, the village miller performed a vital role in the local community, milling locally grown grain into flour for the baker and gristing grains for farmers to produce cattle feed. The miller had to ensure the baker had flour of the quality and provenance he required. During the 20th Century, this link was lost as the traditional artisan mill vanished from the countryside.Today the link has been re-established. I work closely with all our farmers to source the best quality grains for the products our customers wish to buy, whether for sourdough, yeasted breads, cakes or pastries.Yes, all the flours we mill are suitable for use in a bread maker. For best results, use the settings with the longest proving time.The mill shop is open every Thursday from 9am to 1pm and on the 2nd Sunday of each month between 2pm and 5pm. To purchase and pick up flour at other times, please call 01638 741009 to make an appointment.We work to ensure all our flours are milled and dispatched from the mill within four weeks of milling. Much of the flour is dispatched within one week so you always receive fresh flour.All the grains we mill are grown by UK farmers and most of those farms are in East Anglia. We pride ourselves on sourcing locally grown grains and are proud to associate ourselves with our partner farms.Copyright © 2015 Prior's Flour · Prior's Flour is a trading name of Prior Consulting (Cambridge) Ltd · Registered in England and Wales No: 4606269Website by Callia Web Limited" 50384.0 0.0 "The Priors Flour | Cambridgeshire's Premier Organic Flour"

Seventy three hectares (183 acres), the park stretches from the level plateau of gravel and sands of Blackheath in the south, then drops some 30 metres (nearly 100ft) before levelling out on the north side towards the Thames.Opened to the public by George IV in 1830, the park is enjoyed today by thousands of visitors at all times of the year. They come to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, the historic avenues and formal parkland, to play sports and picnic, to watch the deer and other wildlife, and to appreciate the views over London and the Thames.Greenwich Park is the centrepiece of the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site and the setting for the internationally important National Maritime Museum and historic buildings including Wren’s Flamsteed House and Inigo Jones’ 17th century masterpiece, the Queen’s House.Subscribe to our e-mail News Bulletin:Name

Whether you are looking for editorial stock or commercial-ready videos, you will find what you are looking for the stock site’s library. Head over to the website now and get a chance to save up to 30% on your next purchase.When it comes to Getty Images footage, there are a lot to learn about. The stock media site has over 50,000 hours of film in its library, so you have a huge collection to work with. You can choose between commercial and editorial clips to suit your creative needs. There are archive collections and premium content from popular media partners, too. These include works from BBC Motion, National Geographic and even Walt Disney.With Getty, you can purchases two licenses with your stock footage. You can purchase Rights Managed videos in an a la carte basis or download Royalty Free footage with Ultrapacks. Both saves you time and money, so you just have to consider your usage needs and budget. After all, the stock media site has a wide pricing range. Its prices vary according to clip size, resolution, usage and amount of rights needed. In addition to footage, you can also download other media such as images and stills.Getty Images boasts a wide selection of stock footages, a highly searchable library and affordable pricing. It has pricing and plans for all budget levels – thanks to the new Ultrapacks. If you are working with Royalty Free footage, these are the perfect option for you. For huge usage rights, you can also get them by a la carte.Although the stock site has only been in the industry for a little over a year, it certainly has impressed the creative community. Adobe Stock has unique features that make it worth considering, especially for Creative Cloud users. You can work faster as you can search for the perfect image right inside your favorite CC desktop application. Not only that, you can also design comp images, license and manage them directly.As a standalone website, anyone can access Adobe Stock’s library.  Here are a few great things about the stock site that you should know:The launch of Adobe Stock has made the creative process easier for many creative professionals. It has helped Creative Cloud users save time and money by allowing them to design comp images before they make an actual purchase. Most of all, it has provided non-users with premium quality images to create their own masterpieces.In the Internet, you will millions and millions of photos you can use for your blog, website and other projects. Some of them are free. Others are expensive. But, there are also cheap ones. Cheap stock photos is the middle ground that many creative professionals find helpful. While we also recommend using cheap stock photos from these sites to jump-start your creative project, there are some things you need to avoid to make sure you are not breaking your design.Cliché images are images that are commonly used. You can find them everywhere. So before you purchase an image, look at your competitors’ site and take note of the images they are using. You do not want to represent your product or service the way they do. We recommend browsing deeper on the page results to find an image that has not been used many times.When using cheap stock photos, you should do it with extreme care. Take your time in finding the right piece to create an amazing work of art.Vetta refers to the very best collection of imagery from iStock. It is hand-picked by a team of editors for intelligently executed concepts and accomplished art direction. Right now, the stock photo website has over 35,000 Vetta files in its library. That is 1% of the entire image collection. They start at 20 credits per asset for small sizes and up to 70 credits for XXX-large assets. While they have high prices, they don’t scare customers. They still have high demands.The Vetta collection was introduced for two main reasons:The difference between iStock Vetta and the standard image collection is that the former is hand-selected by high performance editors. Each asset in the Vetta collection has something that caught the eye of the stock photo website’s editor and fits the strict acceptance criteria of the collection. On the other hand, the standard collection are images that meet the requirements of the stock site only. They do not involve a high level or artistic risk.The standard collection has the best royalty-free stock images available anywhere. It contains millions of useful and beautiful files. It has a new iStock pricing model that we believe will work well with the stock photo site’s customers. But, iStock Vetta offers something different. The initial collection represents soul and artistic innovation. Most of them have been downloaded a few times. From this small pool of images, iStock aims to grow the collection by adding images that fit the Vetta spirit.iStock was the first microstock agency to offer its contributors to work under the terms of exclusivity. It offers higher royalty percentage in exchange of displaying exclusive images in its file search, enhanced legal protection, and extra promotional actions. After some time, the stock site considered customer trends and developed its exclusive area further. This is where Vetta started – as part of a development. It was then announced in 2009.Now, the iStock Vetta collection contains over 35,000 images and illustrations. Its paradigm is simple and effective. All images are handpicked by a team of high performance editors for exquisite art direction, rarity, and intelligently executed concepts. That is the reason why you will never find the same image in any stock photo website’s library. In some way, Vetta files are the elite of royalty-free images. They are exclusive to the stock site.How much do they cost? To be honest, they are fairly expensive compared to the standard royalty-free images. Their prices are extremely fixed, depending on the size of the image you want to purchase. Not every buyer can afford them, but they will surely mark you out against your competitors. They will bring your product status an extremely high quality.For bloggers, web designers and businesspersons like you, every cent of savings matters. We understand that you have other bills to pay for, including postings and software. That’s why we bring you coupon codes that will help you save more. Currently, we got our hands on Shutterstock coupon codes 2016. This is good news not only to existing members but to new customers as well. Our great relationship with the stock photo website ensures active and valid coupons to you – our avid readers.First, let us tell you about Shutterstock.

At this rate, you will surely find everything you need for your creative projects. All images are of premium quality and are royalty-free. You can use them in any project for as long as you like. They also come with the necessary releases so you do not have to worry about them along the way.Shutterstock accepts all types of payment.

They must be used within one year of purchase. On the other hand, subscriptions can either be annual or monthly.

........> >. . .. . .>>>>............'Contraction & Convergence' or the  'Well Tempered Climate Accord' means both: -. . ..
This image has become a widely used illustration of C&C;  also 'mouse-touch' screen to adjust C&C rates  in this 'live' Carbon Budget Analysis Tool (CBAT)The Objective of the UNFCCC is to achieve a safe & stable greenhouse gas GHG concentration in the global atmosphere. 
                      The Principles of the UNFCCC are precaution and equity. 

Concentration of GHG is rising in the atmosphere & the oceans due to rising human emissions & changing rates of CO2 reabsorption, ['sink-efficiency'].Contraction refers to the 'full-term event' in which the future global total of greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions from human sources is shrunk over time in a measured way to  zero net-emissions within a specified time-frame. The example above shows 90% by 2100. Calculating future emissions contraction, looking at concentrations and sink performance, is a non-random way of responding to the objective of the UNFCCC. 

Convergence refers to the full international sharing of the emissions contraction-event, where the 'emissions-entitlements' for all countries result from them converging on the declining global per capita average of emissions arising under the contraction rate chosen. Converging at a rate to be agreed - the example shows 2030 - is a non-random way of responding to the principle of 'equity' in the UNFCCC, whilst still meeting its objective. Negotiating the rate of convergence is 'the main equity lever'.Contraction and Convergence - ""C&C has the virtue of simplicity.  Equal per capita emissions is a natural focal point. 
                      Contestable computations based on economic variables do not  need to enter the allocation formula."" Professor Ross GarnautTransparently goal-focusing negotiations at the UNFCCC to become teleological this way, recognizes its 'precautionary principle'. 
                      It makes compliance with its objective less unlikely than does the randomness of the negotiations there so far - eg at COP-15 and eg at COP-16Different rates of C&C principle shown here & here & hereFirst tabled at  UN by GCI in 1996 briefing - 
                      Agreed in principle at COP-3 - Described by UNFCCC as ""inevitably required"" at COP-9 - now widely cited and supported - 
                      information on C&C 'rates'  is here - 'incontestability' of C&C is debated here.C&C was adopted in the UK Climate Act in 2008 but then  mishandled  at COP-15 also linked here. 
                      The 'climate-gap' is now wider than ever COP-18 failed to  correct this COP-21 failed to correct this.A draft explanatory movie is here (work in progress)

              managing processes of the coastal zone.Project 
              aims:To develop new versatile diagnostic tools that will 
              identify adverse biological effects of environmental pollutants 
              on fish in coastal and marine environments, to allow coastal managers 
              to detect trends in the state of the coastal ecosystem and assess 
              the sustainability of on-going development, thus permitting the 
              coexistence of a stable coastal environment and a nearby highly 
              developed industrial society.Scientific 
              approach:1. To employ FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC and PROTEOMIC expression 
              analysis to identify a suite of diagnostic gene responses to pollutant 
              exposure in two sentinel inshore fish species ?................

              (P.flesus) and Striped Sea Bream (L. 
              mormyrus )2. To develop practical monitoring tools:i) cDNA miniarrays 
                for qualitative diagnosis of adverse health effects and pollutant 
                class identification 
                ii) quantitative assays (based upon Q RT-PCR and ELISA techniques) 
                for selective impact assessment and long term trends monitoring..3. To validate 
              these tools in field situations through an intercomparison exercise.4. To produce an effects database for community use.Website maintained by S.George, if problems

A HUGE WELL DONE TO YEAR 8!A huge well done to year 8 who have raised £842.11 for the charity 'Read for Good'. Throughout the month of November many of the year group were busy reading and collecting sponsorship money so that children who are receiving treatment in hospital can be provided with books and visits from storytellers. It is pleasing to see our students working outside of the classroom to help others and enhance their love of reading at the same time. All this hard work also counts towards year 8 Graduation and helps our students to understand the benefits of being a responsible and compassionate member of our school community. A fantastic achievement year 8 – very well done indeed!CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FROM THE PRINCIPALDear Parents and Carers,As we get closer to the holiday break, I wanted to write and to wish you all a happy and safe Christmas and New Year, and at a time for catching up with friends and family, to share some personal news of my own.After seventeen very happy years as Head of School and Principal at George Spencer Academy, I have decided to take retirement from August 2019. In my time at George Spencer I have seen the school become an academy, achieve two 'outstanding' judgements from Ofsted, and be recognised as a truly 'world class' school.Our colleagues in our Teaching School, subject Hubs and the Spencer Academies Trust have flourished, and it has been particularly meaningful for me to support the training of hundreds of new teaching colleagues in my time here.Click here to keep reading.YEAR 9 GUIDED PATHWAYSClick here to access the google form.Deadline for completion is Friday 8th February 2019.LAST DAY OF TERMFriday 21st December - 3.20pmStudents will finish at the normal time of 3.20pm for the end of term.INSIGHTThere will be a few changes this year with regards to data and access to information about your child's performance in school.Over the last two terms we have been trialing the use of a piece of software called 'Insight'. This has been evaluated by members of our Parents' Forum and modified to cater for the suggestions they made before being rolled out to a number of year groups as a method for booking Parents Evenings. Our intention was to start the new school year with access to Insight for all families. Unfortunately, you may be aware, that we fell victim to a cyber-attack in July and, as a result, much of our data and information systems were frozen. We can reassure you that none of our data was lost and the integrity of our systems and security has been evaluated externally by internationally recognised organisations and was declared to be more than adequate for a school of this size.Click here to continue reading.Click here for help accessing Insight.INCLUSION LEADER PARENT DROP-INDoes your son or daughter have Special Educational Needs or are you concerned about the possibility that they may have some difficulties with their learning?The Inclusion Leader holds an informal meetings for parents and carers to come and discuss any concerns they may have, the support arrangements for their son or daughter or to share information.

April 25, 2018Posted by Eric b.La prime Eco énergie est un ensemble de technologies énergétiques,c'est à dire Solaires, éoliennes et géothermiques, dérivées de sources sans fin et pouvant être reconstituées à tout moment. La plupart des pays du monde sont fortement tributaires des combustibles fossiles (pétrole, charbon et gaz naturel) pour alimenter leurs économies. Les combustibles fossiles sont des formes d’énergie non-renouvelable, c’est-à-dire qu’ils utilisent des ressources limitées qui finiront par s’épuiser, entraînant une hausse des coûts globaux de l’énergie. Ces mêmes pays ont réagi à la menace en intensifiant leurs campagnes en faveur des énergies renouvelables telles que l’énergie solaire et éolienne.April 14, 2018Posted by Eric bÉconomies de coûts à long terme : les appareils écologiques réduisent généralement vos factures d’énergie et de services publics en consommant moins d’eau et d’électricité, ce qui vous permet éventuellement de faire des économies une fois que ces économies ont payé la différence de prix pour l’appareil lui-même.Protection de l'environnement : Les produits écologiques fabriqués à partir de matériaux recyclés post-consommation ont une empreinte carbone réduit, ce qui permet de limiter la pollution de l'air et de l'eau. 
					En éliminant les emballages pratiques, vous produisez moins de déchets qui auraient été jetés dans des décharges. 
					Les produits écologiques sont fabriqués avec des matériaux qui n'ont peu ou pas d'impact sur l'environnement.May 27, 2017Posted by Eric bIl existe encore un débat assez animé sur les cultures biologiques par rapport aux cultures conventionnelles et sur la raison pour laquelle les gens ont si peur des produits chimiques dans leurs produits de nettoyage, leurs ustensiles et leurs aliments transformés. Les personnes qui utilisent des produits biologiques et écologiques ne jurent que par l'effet secondaire d'une meilleure santé.

The Glasgow Access Panel (GAP) is a registered charity (charity number SCO36531). Our aim is to improve the accessibility of services, buildings, facilities and information across Glasgow for all disabled people.Access issues take a large number of forms. Consider the following examples:In short, if you are not able to make a journey to a service and then use that service without serious disruption to yourself then you are encountering access issues. If you are encountering these, or similar problems in your everyday life, please get in touch!Easterhouse & South Side Drop-In EventsOn the first Monday of every month GAP run an information stall at the new Victoria Infirmary, between 10am and 12pm, and another at Castlemilk Community Centre on the first Wednesday of the month. On the third Wednesday of every month the same service is available at Easterhouse Library. These stalls are an opportunity to meet with members of the community and learn about access issues, and also allow us to recruit new GAP members and to give out information. If you have any questions or issues to report, just come along and we will be happy to help.The Glasgow Access Panel also provide access audits and written reports to organisations looking to improve the accessibility of their premises. For more information on this, see ‘What We Do’, or contact us with any questions, or if you would like to arrange an audit.Glasgow Access Panel

Thermoplastic polyurethane or TPU is a category of plastic with outstanding versatility that designed to meet manufacturing challenges of the modern world because it improves the production and performance of any type of product from shoes to filters and cables. Practically, high temperature polymers are useful for a large number of global industries, from automotive and aviation, construction and agriculture to healthcare. After many years of development, companies managed to create various TPUs with the goal to fulfill application requirements including adhesive, injection molding and compounding. When being exposed to heat, this polymer becomes soft. When cooled, returns to a hard structure. However, the great advantage is that thermoplastic polyurethane stands more than one processing without affecting its integrity. Other characteristics of this type of plastic include high elasticity and elongation, resistance to abrasion and chemicals, tensile strength. For these reasons, TPU is very popular among different markets and applications.High temperature polyurethane can be divided into three classes, namely polycaprolactone, polyether and polyester. Polycaprolactone TPUs are perfect for pneumatic and hydraulic seals because they present resistance to hydrolysis Polyether TPUs present excellent resistance to hydrolysis, good abrasion and durability against microbial degradation, which makes them ideal for watery environments. The last category of TPU and probably the most familiar is polyester, which offers resistance against abrasion and protection against chemicals and oils, thanks to its intensified properties. It is mostly used in polymer blends or mixtures.Regardless of the company that produces them, TPUs must have some common traits in order to differentiate them from other materials. These characteristics refer to the performance of thermoplastic polyurethane and include flexibility, excellent impact strength, resilience to various solvents and grease, high elasticity and abrasion resistance, recyclability. Moreover, they must be pleasant to the touch and easy to color. Manufacturers have the ability to change their physical attributes in order to meet specific requirements in terms of application. Practically, they need to adjust the ration of materials used to produce thermoplastic polyurethane, use additives like mold release agents and change the reaction conditions.Companies use several assessments to measure the longevity and performance of TPUs. The standard measurements include abrasion, shore hardness, tensile and tear strength and shrinkage. Shore hardness has the goal to measure the resistance to penetration or indentation by applying a defined force on the thermoplastic polyurethane. This allows a clear categorization: rigid or flexible. The tensile strength has the purpose to determine the level of endurance before deformation occurs and the tear strength show the ability of resisting distortion or break. Manufacturers encounter difficulties when establishing the shrinkage degree accurately because various parameters influence this action.Chemical properties are of great importance because they control the thermoplastic polyurethane behavior in different environments. Thus, manufacturers must think about high temperatures and outdoor elements that might negatively affect the TPU and carefully analyze its concentration and formulation. Shortly, the finished product must present high chemical resistance when encountering specific substances, including saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons, especially in medical and industrial environments. Companies have high standards in relation to thermoplastic polyurethane.Have you ever considered visiting Scotland? Well, then you may already know that there are two places people prefer to see, Edinburgh and Glasgow. You may think that they are similar, and it does not matter which one you choose, because you will have the Scottish experience either way, but the fact is that they are very different. Edinburgh is famous because it is the capital, but Glasgow is the one that will totally charm you, because here you can visit many museums and you can admire breath-taking street art. Scotland offers a wide range of entertainment activities including gambling games. Nowadays it’s quite easy to amuse yourself by reaching out to web, going to source where you will find impartial reviews like they do on the ValleyGames and choose a popular online casino to kill some time. Everything happens in a place where you are comfortable, so there are plenty of reasons to prefer it. In this article you will find more about the main attraction from Glasgow, and you can decide for yourself if you want to book a flight to this destination.For the ones who do not know, Glenlee is the ship that was refurbished and it stands as the main piece of the Tall Ship museum in Glasgow, and it is important to know its history in order to understand the importance of the museum. This ship was made from steel in 1896, and its purpose was to facilitate the transport of various cargos for the businesspersons of the time. Since 1922 its purpose changed, the Spanish navy used it in educational purposes.Below Decks on the Tall Ship ‘Glenlee’ – Pointhouse Quay – 28 April 2013Nowadays it can be visited under the form of a museum on the Pointhouse Quay. Anderson Rodger built the barque with the full length of 86 meters. Initially it did not feature royal sails because Archibald Sterling & Co. Ltd saw this as an effective strategy to save money. From the day it was launched it was used as a cargo ship for 23 years. The Spanish Republican Navy took the ship in 1931 and they used it as a stationary training boat.Nowadays the boat called Glenlee is owned by Clyde Maritime Trust, and it is considered the main piece of the exhibition from the Tall Ship. If there is an attraction you should put on your list when in Glasgow then this is the one, because since its opening, millions of people took pictures of it. The boat is so important because during its existence it managed to surround the globe four times. Nowadays in the world, there are only 5 boats similar to it, but in the UK it is unique. The purpose of the museum is to preserve the design of Glenglee and to offer people the possibility to understand thoroughly the maritime history of Glasgow. During the year here are organised multiple activities, the majority of them being guided tours. In addition, students can visit it, and they find it extremely important because they can explore every corner of the boat. The ship was modernised in such a way, that it features a mini cinema. Also, the ones who want to bring a souvenir to their families from home, can find a store open on deck. There is an area especially designed for children to play, so it is the perfect place to be visited by families.Bars are peaceful places in general, where people like to hang out alone or with friends and have a good time. In fact, they are civilized places where you will visit most of your life without getting into any bar fights. But during some unfortunate incidents, you may get involved in ugly scruples, fistfights, or may become the target of a broken bottle.Such fights are ugly and may often result in serious injuries. If you think that you are blameless and the attacker was solely to blame for the attack, you can file for compensation.Hiring a solicitor for such cases is always a good idea, as there are many points you might miss if you are building a case by yourself. You can take a look on a list of lawyers at the Solicitors Guru website where you will find solicitors in any UK region. If you interested in the feature when claimant don’t pay fees in case he do not successfully claim compensation – consider the no win no fee deal terms.Before you file for compensation, you need to get proof that the attacker initiated an unprovoked attack without any intention of defense. The defense can be seen as any of the following:In other words, if the attacker attacked you without any legal cause, and you were injured or harmed in any way as a result, you can apply for compensation.First of all, you need proof that your attacker was liable. Filing a police report is useful in such cases, as you can reference to this case while applying for your compensation. Take photographs and videos of the scene if possible, keep records of medical bills and other expenses that are a result of the attack and record the statements of an independent witness who will be willing to speak the truth without taking any sides.You may apply for compensation for the amount of money needed to treat your injuries, the level of seriousness of these injuries, the effect the injury and the fight had on your personal and professional life.You might also claim compensation from the bar itself, if you can provide evidence that the bar is guilty of a breach of duty like not having enough security, or serving drinks to a person who was clearly intoxicated.Even if you weren’t the prime target, but were injured in a bar fight, you can demand pecuniary compensation if you can proof that the injury would not have been caused in such fight.You should always seek advice from an experienced solicitor as he will tell you your chances of winning compensation. You will also know the potential fields of compensation you are entitled to get so that you do not get any less compensation than you deserve.The hydraulic system is incomplete without pressure control valve. This makes them an essential part of every hydraulic device. There are a number of functions which are performed by this device. The upper pressure is not only maintained but these devices also ensure that a particular pressure is maintained in a certain part of device or circuit to which it is associated. The two main types are open and closed valves. Both are used in various industrial applications. An example of the closed valve is unloading and that of the open valve is a relief. The concept of this appliance is not simple and thermodynamics are applied while these are manufactured. Basic of the device are as follows:There are several other terms which are related to cracking pressure or without which the term cannot be explained. Some important definitions are as follows:The device is both auto and operator driven. Pressure override isn’t a problem in some issues but most of the time it is. Pressure override can lead to power wastage and this is its greatest disadvantage.The working of pressure control valve is just like an electrical circuit. The main concept is to save the circuit. Till the amperage of the circuit is below fuse value everything is fine. When the amperage tries to exceed or actually exceed the fuse value it blows. Though it destroys itself but saves the circuit at the same time. The pressure control valve on the other hand ensures that the best alternative path is given to the fluid if hydraulic system pressure reaches the maximum point. For every hydraulic system pressure control valve is a very important as it makes sure that the system is never damaged. Due to the flow of fluid when the pressure reaches the maximum level pressure control valve opens to bypass the fluid. The process continues till the pressure falls. Most of the pressure control valves are automatic in nature and therefore no human intervention is required. There are many types of pressure control valves in the market and depending upon the configurations work for different hydraulic systems.To understand the operation of pressure control valves in full some advantages of the device are as follows:Should you use proxy service or just a simple VPN is a question that might be a pondering one. Both services are designed to conceal the identity in such a manner that no one gets to the user. There are several VPN proxy services which change the user’s identity completely. These services are often free to use and therefore prioritized by the users. Especially the USA VPN proxies are very high in demand. People want to access those sites and online resources which are geo-restricted. The USA is a country with relatively free internet provided to every citizen. Identity spoof therefore ensures that user gets all the required info completely. Let’s figure out what is what with Anta Net guides on VPN service specifics that will also allow you to learn what is desired.When you connect to the internet your computer is the sole medium of communication. Once you are directly connected to the internet it is too easy for the authorities to track your location using your IP address. It is therefore no a secure way to directly connect. When a third system is placed between your communications with the internet which routes the traffic after encryption then it is known as a proxy. The proxy server can be located anywhere in the world. The request packets that are sent to the internet by your computer appear to be generated from proxy server IP. It is therefore again no possible for anyone to track the location of your whereabouts. VPN servers have to devote time and resources in order to encrypt the connections passing through them. This is not the case in proxy servers as it dedicates no resources at all. Millions of users can simultaneously connect to the proxy server and its efficiency remains the same.The two most common protocols that are used in relation to proxy servers are:Below is the explanation of both of them.As the name suggests the proxy is designed to encrypt traffic at the very basic HTTP level. It is a known fact that most of the website names start with HTTP:// or HTTPS:// so such resources are not only encrypted but the identity of the visitor remain anonymous. On the other hand it is a free to use protocol and requires no additional fees as the setup is too simple to setup and there is no need of any additional resources. However it does not handle services which are other than HTTP, for instance POP3 email protocols.The biggest advantage of SOCKS is that it can handle large volumes. However the efficiency is slowed by such a large volume of internet traffic. It is one of the best ways to connect to the internet as it does not distinguish between the traffic natures which are to be encrypted. From HTTP to POP3 it can encrypt all kinds of internet traffic to conceal the user’s identity. Even large torrents having a size in GBs can also be concealed with SOCKS proxy server.The most common gantry cranes feature two supports. One of the pillars can be rigidly connected to the axle (rigid or spatial support), and the other one is hinged (flexible or flat feet). In gantry crane with a span (distance between the crane rails) of less than 25 m both bearings are hard. Track each of the pillars of heavy crane (lifting capacity of 1,000 tons or more) may consist of two or more rails (undercarriage in this case have the spatial equalizer suspension). In some cases the rails are placed at different levels of support at different heights. The semi-crane design implies the bridge resting on one side of runway, and the other one – on the support legs. Trucks are moving the bridge crane. The mechanism of the trolley as lifting mechanism can be mounted on a trolley (autonomous trolley) or on a metal bridge structure. Lifting mechanism is oftentimes mounted on the metal, and a truck equipped with a movement mechanism. Gantry crane has a metal structure: mechanisms of lifting cargo, the trolley and crane movement. Grab cranes are equipped with a special gripper and winch mechanism in the presence of lifting mechanism circuit grapple. If there is a need for orientation of cargo, the carriage is provided with a rotatable part as steel truck cranes.The weight of cable trolleys considering the weight of cargo and towing winch accounts for 5-10% of weight of the nominal load. The cable trolleys are used only by cranes of group mode of 1K – 3K, since rolling cargo rope pulley block on blocks significantly increases the resistance of the trolley, which leads to accelerated wear of the rope. To prevent excessive sagging hoist rope it is necessary to increase the mass of the cargo suspension. Suspension trolley for these cranes is typically produced in two type: monorail and double rail.At monorail cable trolley to reduce bending moment, bending monorail suspension frame blocks are made with spherical support elements. In addition to the limited life of the monorail, an unsustainable position of the truck cab and in the transverse direction. Lateral swinging carts and mobile booths, which can not be rectified using the thrust rollers adversely affect the working conditions of the crane. In the event of lateral loads on the trolley or in case of eccentricity in mechanisms to traverse when lifting cargo pressure rollers have an impact on the bottom chord of the bridge. In some cases, the design implies additional monorails, which increases metal consumption structure. This solution is widely applied in case of heavy loads and work on sophisticated sites, the design is practised by such industry innovators as Granada Material Handling, gantry hoist and overhead crane manufacturing experts supplying the demand across UK and EU markets.The most common type of cranes implies trolleys moving on rails laid on the lower belt. The frames of these trucks ensure uniform load distribution on rail guides. When using trucks with cargo winches at one end of the frame the hinge connection for crossbeam carrier racks with running wheels is hinged. The cable trolleys cross member is attached to the end of a beam on with the pulleys. In this case, the reduced height of the trolley, which allows the frame of beams running wheels mounted on the ends of the axis of the crossbar. To improve the layout of joints resistant to the bridge, in the small-sized motorized vehicles gears are used or gear movement is performed with central drive.In the modern field of metalworking, mechanical method of working with steel alloys is constantly evolving. However, technological progress contributes to the emergence of new, high-tech materials that can hardly be subjected to mechanical stress. Therefore, many productions began to switch to a completely new, high-tech treatment. Ultrasonic machining is a decent example of a modern technology that can not only solve complicated manufacturing tasks, but also be cost-effective. The article is prepared in collaboration with Hilsonic experts, representing the ultrasound technologies-focused company, known for the ultrasonic cleaner lineup in the local UK market.Ultrasonic method of processing is one of the varieties of slotting material handling. The removal of the surface layer with the product is carried out through the emergence of micro cracks under the influence of ultrasound vibrations. The main primary quality of ultrasonic treatment in metals considers the possibility of working on a non-conductive material and an opaque type. As well as the positive characteristics of this method of working with materials, one can designate the absence of residual stress at the end of the working process, which can cause formation damage (cracks) to the product surface. Sonication method is used when dealing with fragile components such as agate stone, plaster-based materials, diamond products and gypsum elements. (more…)According to statistics, 66% of Americans are always talking mention brands when they praise, criticise or recommend any products or services. This is nothing but old, good word of mouth. Andy Sernovits, the author of Word Of Mouth Marketing says that today there is no question about whether you want to have something in common with word of mouth or not, as you are already a part of the game, even if you do not know about how it works. Your company is likely to be discussed on the internet, and the main problem is not the negative reviews, but the fact that you do not participate in this process, and therefore you simply cannot manage it.Word-of-mouth marketing (sundresses marketing or marketing of mouth-to-mouth) – is an alternative marketing strategy that motivates consumers to dialogue about products and services. WOM-marketing takes place through a variety of online and offline tactics, often using agents of influence and communities.The varieties include word of mouth marketing, viral marketing, marketing conversations, evangelism, hidden marketing, marketing and community marketing. Andy Sernovits offers an interesting concept as for determining WOM-marketing, he writes that there is b2b and b2c, and WOM – it b2c2c. According to him sundresses marketing is nothing but C2C: consumer-to-consumer (from the consumer to the consumer), because its essence lies in the talk of ordinary people, which occurs by itself.We’re all plunge into such talks and discuss a variety of companies and their products – when looking for a new phone, a car, an apartment, a hairdresser choose or think what to call the restaurant for dinner.And these discussions have a big impact on us. According to Nielsen survey, which was attended by 29,000 respondents from 58 countries, 84% of them voice their most trusted opinion about products and the companies that they have heard from their loved ones and friends. This figure is confirmed by the fact that all of us have a psychological feature – we give an increased trust to the opinions of close people .Therefore, word of mouth is a natural process, and nobody can escape it. Although it is hard work, WOM can be manageable; in this case it aims to ensure that in the course of such discussions, people refer to your brand so the business has the maximum positive impact.Today, thanks to the Internet word of mouth has become global, the brands are discussed publicly and openly, and most importantly – honestly. Consumers simply describe the experience with a product or service, which can be negative or positive, and it is hardly predictable who will give the first review – an angry or grateful client.That is why you need to be aware of everything that is said about you online. A constant monitoring of reviews, comments on social media, testimonials on specialised platforms is an integral part of efficient WOM marketing management. Usually, the conversations that are beneficial to the brand are started by experienced marketers or agents of influence working for companies on the forums and in social networks. It can either be an in-house staff or a contracting agency, like HTP Digital, an innovative UK-based b2b digital marketing company with an amazing track record. These guys pick ordinary consumers, and the discussion begins to take a large scale, involving more and more people." 53366.0 0.0 "Glen Lee"

The Glenn Miller Orchestra UK was formed in 1988 in conjunction with Glenn Miller Productions of New York. The Glenn Miller Orchestra UK has maintained the exact line-up on stage devised by Glenn, consisting of the leader, five saxophones, four trumpets, four trombones and three rhythm plus a male and female vocalist. The singers perform both individually and as part of The Moonlight Serenaders vocal group. The Uptown Hall Gang - an outstanding Dixieland group drawn from members of the orchestra is also featured.The Band's library comprises of more than 200 scores, many of them from the original library, which includes the great arrangements from both the civilian and Army/Air Force orchestras. The library features contributions from the world's greatest arrangers including Jerry Gray, Billy May and Bill Finegan.Back in the big band era of the 1940's, any dance band worth its salt had a distinctive signature tune. The theme of the Glenn Miller Orchestra was and remains, Moonlight Serenade. Interestingly though, Glenn Miller originally wrote the music of the song as an exercise for a music arranging course. He composed it long before he had organised his orchestra and today Moonlight Serenade is considered a standard in the field of popular music. Its popularity as an instrumental continues undiminished.We have instituted some changes in the music - changes we think Glenn would have brought about himself were he still alive. However, we've stayed true to his sound and style - even when we've added new songs to the repertoire. The new additions have turned out wonderfully, sounding very much the way Glenn would have insisted if he were still here! Quality music always withstands the test of time, ageing gracefully and mellowing over the years. If anything, we believe that the authentic Glenn Miller music is now more popular than ever. We owe it to Glenn to keep it that way.Website built by Andy Potts.   email Sue McVay: suemcvay@btconnect.com  telephone: 0208-905-1065" 53386.0 0.0 "The Glenn Miller Orchestra UK |"

Governor Technology was founded in 2001 as a bespoke software consultancy, focused on internet technologies.
For over a decade, we helped organisations including Microsoft, Citigroup, Volkswagen and the Commonwealth Office harness the power of the web, and embrace new technologies and platforms such as mobile and social media.
During this agency phase, we stayed close to our core ‘nerdie’ interests of research, data and the creation of new IP, and to this end pivoted into the privacy world in 2012.
The catalyst for this were the EU cookie laws, which required web owners to think responsibly about their capture, use and disclosure of personal data via the web. Governor quickly became recognised as pioneers in this space.
Since then, Data Privacy has become front page news and our Cookie interests developed into Optanon, a leading web audit and privacy compliance product, and www.cookiepedia.co.uk, the world’s largest resource on web tracking.
This culminated in 2016 with the acquisition of Optanon, and Governor, by OneTrust, the leading Global Privacy Management Platform based in the US.

All are narrow gauge steam railways and some have a history spanning well over 100 years.

However, no two are the same and they all offer a unique experience of a bygone era.The special attraction of narrow gauge railways lies in their modest size compared with the main line ones and their leisurely speed gives time to take in some of the splendid scenery. Why not take a Virtual Tour of Wales and its narrow gauge railways.Great Little Trains of Wales Discount Card

Moving is a tiresome process which perfectly shows there is no such thing as being perfectly prepared.  If you think , I sell my property fast then quickly move in to an apartment"" then you might be facing some stressful and troublesome times. Let's learn what to pay attention to when moving and on some of the extra costs that you may not count with.This may be a cost you may not count with, but in real if you plan to move out fast (or you are forced to) then you need to get prepared to be able to move real fast. Therefore rent out a storage place for all the things and furniture which you don't necessarily need. You will be shocked to find how easier this will make moving. Also, it'll be much easier for any moving company to collect your things from one particular storage place. There are companies which are prepared to store your products for a while and they even offer logistics and delivering the products you would like to get back to the address you provide them.There is two key things you need during winter: heating and internet. This means you will need to be sure that electricity and internet is fixed by the time you move in. Even if you eventually heat with gas you can buy electric heaters which are capable to heat up one room. With that in mind, get prepared to transfer all your utilities well on time. This way if you must cancel then re-contract with any energy provider you will have time for doing so.Moving trucks are definitely cold and if you are in an area where winter is really cold, then you need to make sure all those belongings which don't react well to cold are very well packed and wrapped so that they don't freeze at least for a few hours.But be prepared having to postpone your moving if the winter is harsh in your region. Winter is not bad for moving but winter storms are. Always make sure your moving is as peaceful as possible including the weather conditions. Make sure you prearrange the costs and agree on all conditions.Moving during winter is harsh but arriving in a house or apartment which is cold as hell is even worse. Make sure to go to your new place a few hours before moving and start the heating.These really don't like cold or freezing cold. If possible use your own car and transport them yourself.This is not the time to look stylish. Apply clothes in layers so that you can take something off if you need to move all too much." 54737.0 0.0 "What do focus on when moving during the winter?"

Building our heritage, offering sustainable brown trout & grayling fishing for this and future generationsSomething to round up the week ?

Also thanks to all the Members that have been out helping with the work. Still three more days …Continue reading “So Far, So Good”The forecast for today was a little harsh to say the least, gales touching “nine” with heavy rain….

A …Continue reading “Storm Callum”I spotted a dimple under a bank. Probably another leaf, or something falling from the overhanging branches or nettles. The afternoon had not been productive, and although I had seen plenty of fish, they had been unapproachable with the river so low and clear here. Then it happened again. Definitely a fish, and it was …Continue reading “A Late Trout Saves a Blank”Yesterdays work party was spent clearing up a fallen willow after Storm Bronagh and there is still plenty of bank clearing left to do in the next planned day – Friday 12th October – see you there Good work Rob, many thanks – John AplinStill plenty of fishing to be had before the season ends, like these two day ticket holders found out… Hi John Had another great day, lots of fish between us most on nymphs and a few on dries, including the big brown Cam had. Thanks again, Steve and CamI agree with comments made by others , it has been a strange mayfly season this year , requiring more effort and covering more water to find a hatch and more importantly rising fish . I found this lovely wild one in an out of the way lie , and made the usual hash of …Continue reading “Strange Mayfly Season”The Club is a private one, founded in 1877, of approximately sixty-four members and six Town Rod subscribers. The Club’s waters consist of about 12 miles of wild brown trout & grayling fishing in the main River Frome, River Cerne and River Piddle, together with attendant carriers and side streams.

The new Graduate Vacancy Partnership is a joint venture between 14 career services in the North West of England. The career services noticed that graduates in this area were not being served to the best of their ability with career services that would encourage their success at every turn. This new service is available to students, graduates and employers who want to see the latest vacancies in the graduate market.How can the Partnership help graduates and employers?Encourage employers to create a wide range of jobs and placements for graduates in the North West. This is a good way of stimulating economic recovery in the area because it helps to create jobs that will sustain the communities around each other.Help graduates find good opportunities – there are many reasons why graduates flock to bigger cities because there tend to be more job opportunities over there. If this sounds like something you are interested in, you should consider using the GVP's services so you can be alerted about the latest jobs and opportunities in the North West.Employers can use the Partnership's website to submit their vacancies for free. The idea behind this is to stimulate all kinds of employers whether they are small businesses or large companies to hire graduates without any extra overheads needing to be paid.The good thing about the Partnership is that in its focus to deliver new opportunities, graduates can stay on the pulse via e-mail update alerts if there are any new vacancies that have been posted on the website.Online Education  If you want to train in a new profession, or gain some added qualifications to bulster your CV, then  online learning may make a great choice for you.

Halse Farm Caravan and Camping Site, is our peaceful, family run campsite in the Exmoor National Park.
Halse Farm Campsite is a small, peaceful park for touring caravans and tents. We are adjacent to the moor on a working farm producing beef cattle and sheep. We are surrounded by beautiful scenery and an abundance of wildlife including the endangered Exmoor ponies which live wild on Winsford Hill, free roaming red deer and soaring buzzards. We have been awarded a David Bellamy  Consevation Award for many years helped by an amazing diversity of bird life and you may well be visited by hedgehogs during your stay which enjoy clearing up food scraps.

Halse Farm Caravan and Camping Site has a quality, clean, heated toilet block, with free hot showers.

Exmoor is a paradise for walkers and nature lovers…walk out of our front gate onto Winsford Hill for miles of marked walks on moorland, in woodland or beside the rivers, all with a good chance of spotting local flora and fauna. We can supply laminated maps of the local area with six circular walks starting and finishing on the campsite with lengths varying from 2 miles to 12 miles. We are an ideal base for walks further afield too. Dunkery Beacon, Exmoor’s highest point is not far away and there is the coastal footpath to the north.

Exmoor was designated a Dark Sky Reserve in the autumn of 2011 and we have excellent viewing from the campsite or you may like to venture onto the moor with a telescope.


The village of Winsford is only a mile by road or slightly further if you choose to walk via the footpath. We have a village shop within the Royal Oak Inn which is open daily from 8.30 to 12.30 except Sundays. It has a range of essentials including papers, bread and milk. It also provides a Post Office service on Tuesday and Friday from 10.00 to 12.00.

The beautiful thatched Royal Oak Inn serves bar and restaurant meals and allows children and dogs and has a garden.Further afield Halse Farm Campsite makes a good base for visits to Dulverton, Dunster, the Doone Valley, the Coastal Footpath and coast towns such as Porlock Weir, Lynton and Lynmouth and 3 miles away are the famous Tarr Steps, an ancient clapper bridge over the river Barle (with a handy pub right beside the river)

Full CAD, 3D printing, Prototyping and bespoke development testing is all available in house.Our in house laboratory works closely with customers at the moulidng design stage to ensure that the material chosen meets their design needs now and will also meet expected future requirements.Material development is sometimes required and in this case we can supply suitable samples of material that can be tested by the customer in the application or in a simulated environment.  This ensures suitability and enables Harboro to develop/modify the compound further until it is suitable.This extensive expertise has allowed the development of processes to provide low PPM and in some cases zero defect production on its manufacture.

We know about Essences and Essences are our passionFlower Essences, or Flower Remedies, were first developed by Dr Edward Bach in the 1920's and 30's. His Bach Flower Remedies are still the most popular and widely used Essence range in the world today.Since then many other ranges of Flower Essences and Remedies have been developed that we source from all over the world.We offerFAQ's
               What are Flower Essences?
               Are they like flower Remedies?
               Are they like essential oils?
               Can I mix them?
               How do I use them?
               Can they help with physical problems?
               More about Flower EssencesWe have a personal relationship with the producers of all of these Essences which are all made with utmost integrity.       These are the ones that we use ourselves and have found to be effective and valuable, whether with clients in a natural health practice, at home, or in any other situation.As therapists ourselves we often observe amazing results using these remedies for all kinds of issues. Flower Essences are safe for people of any age as well as for animals.              You can use the menu on the left of every page to navigate quickly to any area of the site. If you have any difficulty please feel free to phone between 9.30am and 5.00pm on weekdays.If you are new to Flower Essences you may find it difficult to know where to start but different Flower Essence ranges often suit different people and different levels of healing. One approach would be to use our Flower Essence Finder feature. When you click on one of the keyword links you will see all the Flower Remedies that we have to help address that particular issue in all the Essence ranges that we offer.By browsing the different Flower Remedies shown under that keyword you may be drawn particularly to one range of Essences. That is a good indicator of where to start.People who want to try a Flower Essence for the first time often start with an Australian Bush Flower Essence. These help to address issues that are most in the way in everyday life, even if their origins may be in the past.The Bailey Flower Essences often suit people who want to work with issues from childhood that have restricted them living their life to the full.The Alaskan Flower Essence Project  includes  Flower Essences and also Gem and Environmental Essences. These are often chosen by people who have been working with their issues for a while and now want to heal at a deeper level.Bach Flower Remedies seem popular with those who are ""past their first flush of youth"". The language that Dr Bach used to describe each Flower Essence may seem a bit ""last century"" to some people but will resonate with people for whom these Essences are best suited.Indigo Essences are made with gems and chrystals. These are wonderful for children and babies but can also be used for people who are working with their 'inner child' issues.Wild Earth Animal Essences are deeply grounding and loved by people who feel a strong affinity with the animal kingdom. The  'Wild Child Essences' are for children who may need support for particular difficulties they are having through their early years.LightBringer Essences are relatively new and support people who are open to some of the higher frequencies. They will probably be aware of deeper issues in their fields that they want to address. If this isn't a language you are familiar with they may not be for you.We started making the Mediterranean Essences in 2002 and launched them in March 2013 at the BFVEA conference in Glastonbury. They are particularly helpful when we are required to step up and face new challenges  in these times of change. The Mediterranean Essences help us to let go of outdated patterns of belief and behavior, open our hearts and shine our own light.As you browse the site you will find all sorts of other things like the Astrological Essences made by Melissa Assilem.

The National Herb Centre is more than just a garden centre, we provide something for everyone for a great day out.  We are located on the B4100 just outside Warmington Village, 5 miles north of Banbury and 11miles south of Warwick.Herbs for cooked dishes, salads, dressings and sauces.  Everything from artichoke to tarragon.Varieties of hardy lavender including those suitable for hedging & edging as well as the less hardy but decorative French lavenders.Plants used in traditional herbal remedies, often of use to those planting a historic garden.There are so many varieties of these that each has a section of its own in our online shop.A herb is a useful plant.  It might be an annual, biennial or perennial herbaceous plant, a shrub, tree, climber or succulent.
Herbs are used as flavouring in cooking, curing meats, cooking oils, soft drinks, liqueurs, beers and teas. They are also used in cosmetics, medicines, insect repellents and cleaning products.
Many herbs have multiple uses. For example, a hardy Lavender such as Munstead might be used as a flavouring in a cake, an ingredient in a cola drink, an essential oil for aromatherapy, a constituent of soap, shampoo or hand cream, or as insect repellent and perfume in a wardrobe.
Garden plants like honeysuckle, clematis, camellia, ceanothus or phormium that we may think of as purely decorative are, or have been, useful medicinal species in other parts of the world for centuries.Many herbs have multiple uses.

When different loans are paid at various times of the month, the amount is usually much smaller, than if all the loans are consolidated and only one payment is made each month.Whilst it is true that remembering to make multiple payments throughout the month can be a cause for stress, not having the funds to make the one larger payment can also be a detrimental factor.However, with a bit of planning and discipline, this can be easily overcome.Planning for Sufficient Funds to Pay the LoanSaving to Have the Required Funds on the Due DateIt is much easier to put aside a smaller amount each week than to find a large sum at a specific time of the month. There are many ways that can be utilized to achieve this. However, it is very important to open a designated Savings Account for this purpose.Once this is done, there are several ways to get the necessary funds into the account.Although handling one loan repayment requires some planning and discipline, debt consolidation should be seriously considered because it can save time and money.Maybe you live in Louisiana, if so you probably know that home equity loans are popular here because they offer a lot of advantages. This type of loan uses your house as a guarantee for the fixed payment credit. You can apply for a Louisiana equity home loan for any purpose you might have and take advantage of the low interest rates this type of loan has to offer. In addition the monthly payments are tax deductible and many people use the credit to pay off other costly debts.Louisiana equity home loans are very easy to apply for because most lenders are present on the Internet. You just have to log on and fill an application form to receive an answer in just a few days. The lenders analyze the value you requested, you previous loans and income and the value of your house. You can get up to 125% of the value of the house but is it advisable you get a smaller amount than that so you will be able to pay off and cover you debts.When searching for a Louisiana equity home loan compare as many offers you can from different lenders and take into consideration not only the interest rate but also the annual percentage rate. Also make sure you can prepay the credit without paying any additional fees. It is good to know that the higher the value of the equity the lower the interest rate will get.There are some trustworthy lenders for a Louisiana equity home loan One of them is Capital one where you don`t have to pay a fee if you want to prepay your credit and you can get a loan for up to 20 years. The most important may be Chase who has the best interest rates but they do charge a fee for credit prepayment. The Bank of New Orleans and Whitney National Bank are some good alternatives with rather good interest rates. If you are not sure about fees and terms showed on the banks website go to their headquarters and ask for the advice of a consultant.Before getting a Louisiana Equity Home Loan check out some economic predictions about the value of real estate in the area. If it is said is going to rise you should probably wait a little longer in order to get a lower interest rate of your higher equity. If you need to refinance one of your existing loans or pay for something expensive and you take it for a long term this kind of loan is perfect for you.Loan modification is debatably the best solution to your problems when you are lagging on your mortgage and facing financial hardships, to save your home from foreclosure. Modified home loans are something similar to Mortgage Refinancing, in which the prime focus is to discover a comfortable repayment of your mortgage. It is often termed as ‘Modified Refinance’ too. The main point to be noted is that instead of you searching for a new loan, you can simply alter the terms of the existing loan. In this, the loan is restructured so it meets the convenience of the debtor.The bank does not simply modify your loan out of sympathy. They agree for modified loan plans which are essential to have a comfortable repayment plan and make more business sense than the alternative. This has also occurred due to the current economic conditions wherein the homeowners have been badly pinched by the fall of the economy. The idea of modified home loans hence helps both the parties, the bank as well as you.The need for ARMs i.e., Adjustable rate mortgages shall continue through the 2016s and 2017. The best option for the homeowners is to discuss with their loan servicing company and opt for modifications in the home loan terms. Sometimes, when you try for this, you don’t reach the correct person or you are never called back to resolve your problem. Please remember that this is your prime need and not theirs. Hence, if you feel the procedure is taking more time than necessary, then please consult or hire an attorney who specializes with foreclosures and loan modifications.Another solution is to choose a loan modification company that already has an attorney who can answer all your queries and doubts aptly and provide the correct answers to your problems and help you out in a better way.

Welcome to the HR Team UK website We are a small, focused training and development consultancy, established in the UK since 1989. From the outset we were part of a European wide co-operation group. This co-operation group has continued to develop, so that we have well established and proven relationships.  Our mission, when we started, and continues today, is to work with clients in designing and delivering training and development programmes, linked to the clients strategy and goals, in the areas of leadership and management, personal development and sales/ account management. Over the last 20+ years our services have developed, but we have never moved from the core principles and values that we started with – these are described in the “our approach” section of this site. During this time we have developed an enviable client base of organisations from a range of sectors, in the UK and mainland Europe. The biggest single addition to our services during this time has been the creation of a as suite of training modules in supplier management. This is still a niche training area, one in which we have enjoyed rapid growth – to the point where we a launched a separate brand  in 2006– Supplier Management Training. More of that later! The purpose of this site is to provide you with a summary of what we do, and how we do it. The core content is split into 4 areas • Leadership and management • Sales and account management • Our European delivery capability • Supplier management .HR Team UK Ltd Pantiles Chambers 85 High Street Tunbridge Wells Kent TN11XPTel: 01892 506876      Fax: 01892 547120     Email:info@hrteam.co.uk" 59851.0 0.0 "Home - HR Team UK Ltd"

Hypnotherapy is increasingly being used to treat a variety of disorders
from physical conditions to problems of a psychological or emotional nature,

         Stopping smokingHypnotherapy is increasingly being used to treat a variety of disorders
from physical conditions to problems of a psychological or emotional nature,
for example:This is a list of just a few of the many conditions and situations that can
successfully be treated or improved during hypnosis in a confidential caring
and non-judgemental environment, however hypnotherapy is not a substitute for medical care or attention.topThe word Hypnosis is derived from the Greek word Hypnos which means sleep.
Despite this derivation a person under hypnosis is not actually
asleep.  Hypnosis is a state of consciousness during which the mind remains
focussed and alert, concentrating on mental, sensory and physiological
experiences.  The hypnotic state is different to either wakefulness or sleep
and is one in which awareness of the outside world becomes reduced and the
mind comes into close contact with the inner self.  Hypnosis is a very
pleasant state to be in, muscles relax, there is a reduction in heart and
respiration rates and one becomes very calm.  Hypnosis is a naturally
occurring phenomena, it is non addictive and has no unpleasant side effects.
When a Therapist induces a trance state the individual is empowered to make
changes in his/her life which he/she feels would be beneficial.  These
benefits can be physical, behavioural or emotional.Yes anyone who is willing can be hypnotised.  The depth of trance will vary
from person to person but the therapy can be just as effective in light or
heavy trance.  The only people who cannot be hypnotised are those who do not
want to be hypnotised.Hypnosis is sometimes erroneously looked on as a form of mind control.  People
in old films are often portrayed as being forced to act against their will or
better judgement and volunteers in hypnosis shows exhibit strange behaviours.
In fact it is impossible to override the will, our unconscious mind looks
after us all the time.  If a hypnotist were to try to coerce someone to do
something which ran counter to their own value system the individual would
either ignore the suggestion or come out of trance.  Volunteers in hypnosis
shows have made an inner commitment for the sake of entertainment and are not
forced to do anything.topThis is useful for dealing with certain addictive behaviours such as smoking
or nail biting and also for one off situations such as exam nerves 
This therapy requires clients to allow themselves to go into a hypnotic
trance during which the therapist makes suggestions aimed at bringing about
the desired result.  

One or two sessions are usually required and sometimes a booster session can
be useful.  


 
Analytical therapy is used to discover root causes of psychological problems.
Hypno-Analysis reveals then removes these causes thereby relieving any
resulting symptoms.  The use of conscious hypnosis dramatically speeds up
analysis and the results of 6 to 10 sessions are comparable to conventional
""1000 hour"" analysis.
The object of Analytical therapy is to bring the individual to a moment of
liberating enlightenment.topOver the course of many years she has worked with thousands of people of all ages and from every walk of life and
has helped to deal with all sorts of issues from the simplest to some of the most complex and unusual.  She also
specialises in working with people who do not speak English as their first language.
She believes that everyone should be able to live life to the full.  She helps people to explore and discover the kind of
changes they want to make for themselves, to help break down barriers that may be holding them back, empowering them
to leave the past behind and live life in the present.  She is particularly interseted in working with deep-rooted
problems, to help create the kind of lasting success, at a deep, automatic, sub-conscious level, and to help the
individual achieve happiness and fulfillment in a warm and caring, confidential and non judgemental environment.

Nigel Magowan is an experienced Manchester Hypnotherapist, a BACP & UKCP Registered Psychotherapist, an Accredited Contemporary Psychotherapist, an EMDR Therapist, an NLP Master Practitioner, Life Coach and Ecotherapist. He has undergone significant and in-depth training in psychotherapy, EMDR, NLP and many styles of hypnosis and hypnotherapy. He has been in full-time practice since 2002, and over the years has carried out literally thousands of therapy sessions with his clients, giving him the experience and skills to work flexibly and effectively with almost any psychological issue you may have.At his Manchester Hypnotherapy practice, Nigel always combines psychotherapy with clinical hypnotherapy, NLP and CBT.Hypnotherapy can make it easier to explore and change your thoughts and behaviour patterns, and gain deeper insights, enabling irrational fears, anxieties, habits, negative thoughts and behaviours to be explored and altered.  Like other talking therapies, Hypnotherapy involves an active participation between you and the therapist. It is not a ‘magic wand’ or something that is done to you ‘while-u-wait’. Hypnosis itself is a natural state of highly focused attention and awareness, quite similar to what you might experience while daydreaming or relaxing.  Hypnotherapy is a generic term for any therapy process that is carried out while you are in hypnosis. Contrary to how hypnosis is often portrayed, you always remain aware and in control.Nearly everyone can benefit in some way from psychotherapy, counselling, clinical hypnotherapy, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), EMDR,  or life coaching. Whether you want to change a habit, deal with anxiety, build confidence & self esteem, improve your sleep, increase motivation, rid yourself of a phobia or some other emotional problem, or improve a skill you already have, hypnotherapy, NLP, psychotherapy, counselling and coaching can probably help.Once you are committed to making the inner changes you want to transform your life, just telephone me on 0161 881 4333 to schedule your first appointment now at the Manchester Hypnotherapy practice.  Alternatively press the button below to ask me to call you back. If you have any questions you want to ask before booking then do give me a call or email me. Exactly how much is your health and well being really worth to you?Often our mind can’t tell the difference between the thoughts about a situation and the situation itself. Therefore by simply thinking, worrying or ‘what if’-ing about something you are actually activating the fight-or-flight response in exactly the same way as if you were experiencing it in reality. I specialise in treating the various anxiety disorders and frequently work with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, OCD, PTSD, Social Anxiety, Phobias, Fear of Public Speaking, Blushing and Interview Anxiety.By using a powerful combination of psychotherapy, clinical hypnotherapy, EMDR, NLP and life coaching we can work together to address the underlying causes, build new behaviours, shift your focus, remove limiting beliefs and build new empowering beliefs about yourself and your abilities, so that your self-esteem and confidence just continue to grow and grow.The treatment for depression is available at my Manchester Hypnotherapy practice, and is highly tailored to each person’s unique requirements, so the exact form of treatment and number of sessions will vary from person to person. However significant improvements can often be made in as little as 8 to 12 sessions for single very specific issues.Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterised by a persistent difficulty falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep. Initially people often find they can’t get to sleep because their mind is full of thoughts about their problems. However after a while, it is often the worry about your inability to sleep, that becomes a major factor in maintaining the insomnia. The treatment combines various helpful approaches, such as sleep education, relaxation, hypnotherapy and psychotherapy, and is highly tailored to your unique individual requirements.A wide variety of weight and food related issues, and the various eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia can be treated using a flexible integrative approach that combines psychotherapy/counselling, clinical hypnotherapy, NLP and life coaching.I combine Clinical Hypnotherapy, Psychotherapy and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) which are individually recognised as highly successful ways of changing people’s behaviours and perceptions.For enquiries about Inner Changes Manchester Hypnotherapy, Psychotherapy, Counselling, NLP and Life Coaching call 0161 881 4333.What Are Anxiety Disorders?

The Rolling WebsiteIt was another Fruit Boot Shootout event, this time The FBSO Pork pie pud slides Melton Mowbray massacre out in the sun, making the most of our Great British Summer ™. As is customary with these events it was first and foremost a session. An excuse to get together and skate. Once the midair collisions were over and the ambulance left with the first (and thankfully only) casualty of the day that’s how it turned out. As Glenn departed with a second head growing from where the first impacted the concrete everyone else, glad to see him walking unaided got back to the matter at hand – finding the lines to be had at this little outdoor park.It seems that lines were found as you can see above. After a few hours of rolling the smooth curves and banks of this particular location prizes were given for best trick and best overall skater. Both going to Jake Ricketts for his exemplary performance all day.Returning to Adrenaline Alley again for the first big event of the UK calendar with a host of skaters from around the world.Not much to say. A great friendly event with some amazing skills. We don’t all get together all that often but when we do, it goes down.Probably the last main event of the year in the UK The Food Fight was down in Corby at the redesigned Adrenaline Alley skatepark. Great chance to skate the park, meet up with skaters from all over the country and of course battle for some prizes. As is standard I took the camera and here’s a few shots from what I caught…Back to Barry again this year for the Richard Taylor Trophy. As always it was a great day with loads of people turning up to skate, chill, meet up, relax and generally enjoy the day. With some competitions and generous prizes thrown in there was something for everyone.Thanks as always to Gaynor, Rob and all of the locals who put on the event and the sponsors that supported it.Of course, if you want some video…
Continue reading Richard Taylor Jam 2016A change to the organisation this year but a familiar feel to what is an established and friendly annual event at The House skatepark. As Noiya were not holding the reins this year it was picked up by Bobby Smith and the local crew of Forged From Steel. A wholly appropriate moniker for such a down to earth skate session and competition. With an impressive $950 in the prize pot and a load of extra goodies shared between the 2 classes and best trick, many turned up for the event but went that extra mile for the prizes.So, here’s a few shots for you…And I thought I’d grab a few clips at the end of the day and put them together too..Next time you hear some incredible claims about how some proprietary bearings are so good, particularly backed by claims about how long they spin for, remember:– 608 bearings were designed for low radial load, zero axial load, high speed operations. In skates they are expected to do the opposite, so tolerances measured on the ABEC rating are pretty meaningless– most of the bearings you will see for sale come from one of a very small number of Chinese factories. They will mostly be identical products to their competitors with different branding and packaging.– there are many factors which affect your speed far more than the bearings you use. For example, the wheels you use (size, profile, hardness, rebound) the frames they are in, the types of spacers used and obviously your own fitness. Bearings don’t even figure as long as they aren’t wrecked– which brings us to maintenance. Simply cleaning and lubricating your bearings occasionally will extend their life immeasurably. Longer than the wheels, frames or even your skates. Don’t neglect them to the point they no longer turn then fork out for the latest ABEC 11’s.– and finally, don’t believe people who demonstrate how great their bearings are using the “spin test”. For reference see belowIn short, don’t fall for the hype. Don’t get screwed.On the back of a few popular events came the first Fruit Boot Shootout and it was another great day out. Held at The Asylum Skatepark in Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire there were visitors from all over the UK and beyond. What I was glad to see was the skaters that turned up just to enjoy the day and the competition was the excuse to come down, not the reason. So many skaters old and new just skating to have fun at an amazing park with so many lines.Well, as usual I had the camera out so took some shots. I also grabbed a handful of clips and if I put together a few of them into a mini edit I’ll add that below too.So, I was buzzing the old Time Machine through the vaults of Internet history and I come across some gems of old media. There’s more to come but I couldn’t help but grab as many of the edits as I could from the old UKSkate website, back in early 2003 when it was truly the hub of UK blading. The forums, the edit competitions, the hate; it was all there and now unfortunately lost to the march of time. Well, mostly.So, if you want to reminisce over 240p footage of unity cess slides and XXXXL joggers at 10 fps, then have a gander, there’s some gems on YouTube now.Second in the informal series of events organised by David Wing and Stephen Swain. After the success of the first session at Adrenaline Alley, the next venue was chosen to be one of my local parks, Rampworx. Another great attendance from all over the UK as rollerblades outnumbered everyone at the park, even the scooters. Well, I took a few shots and even grabbed a couple of clips from the chilled skating that was in evidence all over the park…Photos:

A massive thank you to Simon at  Internetbuff for dramatically increasing our website exposure over the last 3-5 months.Internetbuff stepped in to pick up the development of our site and we couldn’t be happier with their work. They were professional, responsive and easy to deal with throughout – and importantly we are really pleased with the final product. I would be happy to work with them in the future as the site and business grows, and would certainly recommend them. Thanks!Many thanks to Simon for his patience. I am a complete novice at websites but with Simon's professionalism and dedication to producing superb websites he has helped me with two excellent presented websites. 5 * service.Simon recently revamped our website, setting up a one-page design. We are extremely happy with his work, and he was excellent at bringing our ideas to life. We were particularly keen on ensuring the website was responsive, to ensure the site appeared correctly on mobiles and tablets. This, along with the parallax design, was handled expertly. Simon produces quick results, but the work is of the highest quality. We would strongly recommend Internetbuff to fellow businesses, and are delighted to add our testimonial to Simon's large collection of happy customers!Just had to write to say thank you and how pleased we both are with our new website. It looks so fresh, slick and professional and the feedback we've already had from existing clients has been extremely positive. We now come up on page one so the SEO seems to be working well. The design process was very smooth and working with Dropbox made the swapping of files and ideas so quick and simple. Many thanks once again.If you want a website that looks professional and fits your expected criteria then Internetbuff is the right choice. I have no hesitation in recommending this company, Simon is very approachable and was able to define the exact look I was after. Professional looking site for a great price! Thank you.I have been delighted by the speed and helpful manner in which Simon has created a stunning website for me. Working with groups and individuals in both China and the UK, I was concerned that the website should prove equally attractive to both markets and this certainly seems to be the case. By the use of just one click customers can learn about the company in either English or Chinese. I have already received some very positive comments from my Chinese colleagues and am confident that my new website will bring further business to my growing company. I would recommend Internetbuff without any reservations.Simon has been very helpful and understanding with us when designing and building our website. The whole process has been efficient and no task was too much of a problem for him. I would definitely recommend The Internetbuff to anyone looking to build a website that draws people attention, whilst still providing the key information. After completion Simon has also provided assistance in the managing of the website which is also very much appreciated! 10 out of 10I chose Simon to work with me on my website as after a meeting with him, it was clear that he had an open mind and was able to understand the sometimes, not very clear points I was trying to put across. Throughout the process Simon was prompt and professional. Generally all updates and communications came within 12 hours of me responding and in the end it was me who held up the process as everything was done so quickly ! I also felt comfortable asking for changes and saying when I didn’t like a concept. At no point did Simon make me feel uncomfortable and he always came up with an alternative. Many of the aspects that ‘make’ my website were Simon’s suggestions. I would highly recommend Internetbuff and have already embarked on another venture with Simon.Reliable, efficient and with great integrity. Internetbuff has been very creative in their approach to tackling our needs of creating a site that meets the very high standards required for a British Secondary School provision which is addressing education needs in the 21st Century virtually! I would recommend Internetbuff to anyone considering a website for their organisation.When initially looking for a web designer, we requested further information and quotes from around 15 companies. We were immediately impressed by the speed and quality of the response; qualities that were present throughout the experience. We have been extremely impressed with the service provided by Internetbuff. The website was a complicated task, and Simon was completely unfazed by this, and in addition, came up with various excellent ideas and improvements to the original specification. I have no hesitation in recommending Internetbuff to businesses looking for a quality end product, but in addition, someone who goes above and beyond the service expected.Designing and optimising websites since 2001, we're web designers passionate about great website design, ecommerce and online marketing." 62118.0 0.0 "Website Designers | Web Designers | Ecommerce Website Design | Southend, Essex, UK"

IPWFI Ltd has traded since 1991, offering both insurance backed guarantees and deposit indemnity protection to the home improvement industry 
on a wide range of products ranging from, windows, doors, conservatories in either, UPVc, Aluminium or Hardwood as well as soffits and fascia's. 
With a membership in excess of 2000 double glazing companies comprising of small local companies to some of the 
largest in the UK we have gained an excellent reputation and are well recognised as well as respected throughout our industry sector. 



As an Appointed Representative of HomePro Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, 
and through our partnerships with other organisations, 
we are able to provide a wide range of benefits for our members, some of which are shown below:

  Insurance Backed Guarantees
  Deposit protection for up to 25%
  Public and Employers Liability insurance
  Conciliation ServiceAll companies applying to become a member of IPWFI are put through a vetting procedure which includes obtaining 
references from suppliers and past customers as well as the financial stability of both the business and its owners/directors.

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
IPWFI is an Appointed Representative of HomePro Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the FCA.



As an Appointed Representative, we are allowed to deal in the administration of general insurance. 
This means that we provide the insurance to the customer direct, 
thereby ensuring that the member does not have to worry about the rules governing insurance backed guarantees and deposit indemnity cover.

Deposit Indemnity Protection
This indemnity protection, which is underwritten by *Guarantee Protection Insurance Limited or **Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe) Limited, provides cover for up to 25% of the 
contract value and lasts for 90 days from the date the deposit is paid.



Should the member company cease to trade through liquidation, bankruptcy or death of the principals prior to any work commencing, 
the customer will be able to make a claim.

Insurance Backed Guarantee

The guarantee, which again is underwritten by Guarantee Protection Insurance Limited or *Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe) Limited, 
mirrors that of the member’s own guarantee, subject to the terms of the Insurance Policy, 
and provides cover for up to 10 years of the full contract value of the installation for repairs or replacements in the event of the member company 
ceasing to trade through liquidation, bankruptcy, or death of the principals.

Why Does The Customer Need A Guarantee?

The installing company has to provide its own guarantee and providing it remains in business the consumer will never have to resort to 
the insurance backed guarantee for remedial work. 
However, there are an alarming number of consumers who have had problems only to find that the original installing company has 
ceased to trade and have had to find the costs of having the problem rectified themselves.



Choosing a company that are members of our organisation and having an insurance backed guarantee will 
ensure that you have peace of mind should anything go wrong and the member company has ceased to trade, 
as any problems will be rectified with the minimum amount of fuss." 62437.0 0.0 "Insurance Backed Guarantees and Deposit Indemnity Protection"

Day began with walking at the beach where creatures drew patterns in the sand. Lines drawings of journeys.Later, coffee with a friend and I was reminded of some work that I keep seeing. First it was a giant sparrow on the wall of a building in Haverfordwest. I drove around town twice so I could take a second look. Beautiful. Then in the homes of friends, small birds landing.I remembered that the gallery in Solva had some of this work in the window, so went to see, and found…Warren’s work is gorgeous. Understated, beautifully drawn, small souls of birds painted on wood. Each bird looks as if it might fly away any second. And the gallery is such a peaceful, interesting place to be.I bought a small flock to hang on the walls once I have painted them. We talked about the shape of birds, how all drawing is from memory, how to catch that shape and how the only way to learn is to do, over and over. And after I had bought a robin and four sparrows I said he really should put his prices up. (My advice is to get in there now and fast, because these are such beautiful creatures)You can see more of Warren’s work in Oriel Fach in Solva, near the Harbour Inn, or online on his website.The last year has been a whirl of a year. Far too much away from home, not enough time spent painting, but when I did it was with a sharper focus, I think, and a stronger desire to learn and grow.Sometimes it’s hard to find the words that are needed. This blog post is just to say thank you. Thank you to all of those who found The Lost Words, took it to their heart and helped it to grow, from bookshops to readers, to all of those who took it upon themselves to fund raise to place the book in schools, hospitals, care-homes, hospices, thank you. To all those who donated to make the crowdfunders into such a success, thank you, and to our publishers for being open to such an astonishing movement of people, thank you.  And look at these crowdfunders. Aren’t they amazing! And there were others, where The Wildlife Trust in Suffolk, Norfolk, Herefordshire, and more partnered with people to raise the funds. And The John Muir Trust gave us a platform for the Explorer’s notes and under the guiding hand of Rob Bushby we reached out to so many teachers, explorers. And thank you again to Hamish Hamilton for supporting and extending this to the Challenge Cards, which, like the Explorer’s Notes was crafted by Eva John with help from Robert and myself.And thank you to all the teachers who have taken The Lost Words into the hearts of their schools. The work both Robert and I have seen inspired by the book is amazing, and the enthusiasm the children have shown is incredible. At one school Father Christmas reported to me that all the children were full of talk of kingfishers, acorns, wrens and nexts and when asked what they wanted for Christmas it was their own copy of the book. How utterly amazing and beautiful.Thank you to Compton Verney who continue to tour The Lost Words Exhibition, and to the 52 000 plus visitors to the show so far. It’s been such a pleasure working with all the people at Compton Verney, and The Foundling Museum and The Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh were just amazing. It’s such a privilege to have my work shown in such amazing places. ( The next venue is Nyman’s Gardens in West Sussex and I will be there for 2 days talking to people about the paintings and signing books.)Thank you to Hay Festival for making The Lost Words their Book of the Year last year. If you don’t know the Hay Player then follow the links, for those who couldn’t make it Hay sometimes record, sometimes film…Both Winter Fest with Robert and Summer Fest with Kerry Andrew and Nicola Davies were amazing!And thank you for all the coverage in the press for the book, but mostly thank you for this thoughtful piece from Daegan Miller which grew from this amazing review.I think the best way we can say thank you is to begin work on something new. Over the last few months Robert and I have been talking, with each other, with our publisher. It’s time now to settle to work, to make a new book. That will be our best way to say thank you, to try to craft something, together. Another creature that we hope will find a way to hearts in the way that The Lost Words has. Not a book for children. Just a book for people, of all ages. As we settle into it, let it embed itself into our hearts, we will be able to say more.But for now, just thank you. And I hope your Christmas is a peaceful one, and as good as it can be.Hares and their storiesBecause I can, and because it eases my soul to do so I’ve taken to ink again. These inky twisters are for sale for the library fund that will be held at Kenilworth bookshop for Paddox school.Once upon a time I was a child. I know the power of a school library to change lives, open minds, encourage empathy. When I grew up we had so few books. A book was a luxury. I remember taking slim pocket money into W H Smiths to buy a book, being so scared that I would ‘get it wrong’, buy the wrong book. Libraries, with librarians, and teachers, help children to find the right book. And some bookshops, most indie bookshops, will do the same thing. They grow the readers of the future.Otters, made from ink, can turn money into books. So these are offered for sale, and the money will go to Kenilworth books for the children of Paddox school, and maybe, if the teachers know of a child who really could do with a book at home, to keep, then they could quietly gift that child a book from the library, or from the book fund. Because I hear more and more of children who have no books at home. Children who are scared to go home and children who cry because they will be hungry when they go home.Kenilworth Books is a wonderful indie bookshop. I’ve watched Tamsin and Judy help people find the right books. Many in publishing are so comfortable with books and reading they fail to realise that not everyone feels like that, and that fear can be a wall that excludes people from the joy of reading. It’s almost as if we are in a club, but don’t make it easy for others to join. My parents weren’t big readers. They didn’t know about which books I would enjoy and couldn’t guide me. But they did know that the ability to read was important. Beyond the simple mechanics of being able to read there’s the alchemy that can take you anywhere. Reading is the only way to time travel. It’s intimate, as that one voice of the author whispers inside your head. It can open your mind, help you live other lives, see other places. It’s my passion and my joy.So, I ask you to help me. Each of these otters is £250. To secure an otter email me with the words ‘otters for books’ in the subject matter. I will place them below to help identify which otter. Then I will tell you how to pay. Thank you. The auction still continues until this eve, unless more bids come in. Now, I’m off to play with ink.I have to confess to being utterly confused by the new interface with wordpress, BUT I want to auction a piece of work for a school library, so I will try my best to make this work, but if I am silent for a while afterwards it’s because there are things I would rather be doing than trying to get to grips with this. But first, a puffer fish Christmas bauble.Last week I went into a school in Rugby. The school had been working on The Lost Words, and there was wonderful work on the windows to greet us as we arrived.I get so many requests from schools to visit, and so many are working on The Lost Words, often using the Explorer’s Notes written by Eva John. But I can’t go to them all. I need to be home, making new work. This visit had been planned for a while.In front of an assembly of children and teachers I talked about how the book came to be, and why, and how it was made and then using an otter spell, speaking an otter out from the brush in ink and water I painted otters. Later, as two classes watched, asking questions while I worked, I a wren on an acorn, a small dragon.  Kenilworth Books supported the event, and Tamsin had been in the school before me, working with the children. They are the most brilliant bookshop who work so hard to support authors and illustrators, independent publishers, build readers of the future. They help to find grants for schools to purchase books for school libraries and bake the best biscuits. Oh, and do other amazing things too.After school parents bought books for the children. I left the two big otters I had painted for the school library, and the wren on the acorn and the Paddox dragon, to watch over the school, but the other otter came home with me. Because the other otter has a job to do.This otter is a different kind of library otter. And now this otter has white gold letters, and an otter spell, Robert Macfarlane’s, but written by my hand in pencil, and gilded splots, and now this otter is for auction.To bid on this otter, who is painted with sumi ink on watercolour paper, gilded with white gold leaf and is 75 x 56 cms leave a comment on this blog post with your bid in £. The reserve on the otter is £100. I’m happy to post anywhere in the world. The money raised will be paid to Kenilworth Books where it will be held for the school library of Paddox school to draw on to buy books for the school. ( Like many bookshops Kenilworth offer a discount to schools, as well as advice on new and brilliant books and fantastic backlists by authors) It’s like a Christmas present to a whole school. The auction will close 24 hours AFTER the last bid has been placed…….. so, it may take a day, a week, a month, but probably not so long….. but it’s not like eBay where people can sneak in a last bid before it times out. The aim is to raise as much money as possible for the school. All comments have to be actioned by me. And I will try to keep an eye on the blog, and authorise comments. As auction comes to a close I will contact bidders by email. Please email me if you have any questions, or if you wish to keep your bidding anonymous, and I will add your bid for you.If you could, please share. Help us turn ink into otter into money into books into readers. And, well, I seem to have got to grips with the new interface, so maybe an old dog can learn new tricks. Right, I’m away to read my book. And Ivy is very pleased to have me home.This time last year there was a crowdfunding movement to raise money to place a copy of The Lost Words into every school in Scotland. The campaign raised so much, and it was possible to send with each book the printed notes for teachers to help them use the book to inspire learning. On the success of the campaign more grew, and a community of people blossomed, helping each other to find ways through large and small donations across Britain, colouring the country with places where mine and Robert’s book has been given to schools. We’ve seen amazing work produced by incredible children with teachers just astounding us with their creative use for this tool, this book, that we made.In Suffolk the campaign was led by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust, and books often flew into schools accompanied by owls.Harry, who makes murals, has made this wonderful map that he updates regularly as new areas spring up and new campaigns become successful. Robert and I have tried to support where ever we could. For Suffolk we made a piece of art that became something like a ‘raffle prize’, a feather of a barn owl, and also a print of an owl with a new barn owl spell that became a book plate for each book. Inked otters became a new form of currency.The movement spread and in Wales Earth Science Partners raised money to place the book in care homes, and in Oxford, a movement grew to put a copy of the book in every hospice in the land, and work onto the walls of Sobell House Hospice. Amazing.In support of The Lost Words for Kent Robert is donating one of the few remaining limited edition prints, of the kingfisher, for auction. This is produced by Aquarelle Publishing who are a joy to work with. They worked and worked to find a way to gild the prints, and this is Robert’s personal artist’s proof of the special edition gilded kingfisher.Kingfisher was the place we began The Lost Words, in 2015. Robert wrote the spell as his first acrostic, and I painted, not this one though. This was my third attempt, and this is the one used in the book.There are only 2 of these artist proofs. The other belongs to my sister.I’ve held auctions before on my blog. This is how it works. The reserve for this is £350. To bid you leave a comment on this blog post with your bid in £s. All money will go to The Lost Words for Kent schools.All comments have to be actioned by me, so sometimes things get muddled, your bid will only appear when I have authorized it, but I will email you if someone has bid more, and usually, somehow we make it work. The auction ends 24 hours AFTER the last bid has come in. It’s not like eBay where you can wait until the last minute and sneak a bid plus a quid in. And as the last few bidders are left standing I will email to let bidders know if they’ve been outbid to see whether they want to  place another bid.Although it is a print it is unique in that it has hand written piece on front and Rob is happy to write the whole of the kingfisher spell on the reverse of the print and dedicate if requested. You can find out more about the pieces here at Aquarelle’s website.If you would please share the post that would be wonderful.At the beginning of the year I was asked to ‘express an interest’ in a commissioned piece of work. The request took me by surprise, but once I had written, confessed my ignorance, had the procedure explained to me I thought about it for a while.The commission was for the atrium and walls of the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore. The history of the hospital linked the outside, the natural world, to health. The site had been moved from central London to the greener edges of the city where the air was purer.The Lost Words had already brought us many stories of healing, so it seemed the best idea to pitch to somehow take the core of the book, the close connection with the natural world, as the central idea for my ‘pitch’. For this I needed help, from Robert, for his words, but more especially from Alison O’Toole, who designed The Lost Words. Together we put forward our pitch, moved on to the next phase and then I had the terrifying experience of my first job interview in my life, before a board of interested people, from the chair of the charitable trust, to doctors, nurses and surgeons working in the hospital.Over the next few weeks Alison helped me to show how the book could work, transferred to the walls. My initial vision had been a kind of freeze along the walls, but Alison, well, she had better ideas. What followed, once we had won the job, to decorate the corridors of four floors of the hospital, eighty panels in total, was a very steep learning curve.Each floor was colour co-ordinated, and the children’s ward was the Buttercup ward, so Robert was commissioned to write a buttercup acrostic, especially for the ward. I looked around and found out of season buttercups growing at the airfield. A morning lying down in the long grass, a few days painting buttercups and Alison magicked up a meadow.Alison took elements of images from The Lost Words and other books, and paintings of mine, and made a tapestry, rich with colour, but also singing with space and light. On each of the panels in the Buttercup Meadow there is a small vole to find. We both thought long and hard about the people who would use the building, see these walls every day. The patients, parents, visitors, doctors, nurses, cleaners, surgeons, clerical staff. Alison thought about how people move around, on stretchers, in wheel chairs, walking. She is also a nurse, or was before design won her away, and she knows how people move around in a hospital environment, so words where placed where people could stop and read and not be in the way. And we thought about those patients who would spend considerable time in the place, trying to leave small gifts for them to find. And at the nurses’ stations, something special. Here, a small otter, playing.Each floor tells a story. And somehow Alison has made the place seem lighter, filled with air, fresh, alive.I painted seven bluebells, Alison made of them a bluebell wood.She took a handful of finches and made a charm.A single minnow, painted in the margins of my time in a shepherd’s hut in Derbyshire became a shoal of minnows, and the waterweed also, a few strands, threaded into a wonderful underwater world where otters play and kingfishers dive.Newts hide in the waterweed, and a frog, and tadpoles. Some of these were newly painted. Alison gave me a list of ‘things required’. A diving kingfisher, a rising otter, a heron, pond weed, a fox, and I painted as fast as I could and sent them for scanning.A few willow branches were made, by Alison, into a dense tree, with luscious green foliage.It is remarkable to see the finished result. Anyone who knows the book well could have a great time working out what was drawn from where, and what is new. Bees buzz through the walls and on the top floor a ladybird had come to join them. I  had painted a ladybird, but this wasn’t mine, but a real one, seeking a place to hibernate.This could not have happened without the skill and courage of Alison. She worked until 4 am many mornings, taking the small vision I had for the work far beyond anything I had imagined and enhancing my paintings beyond my imagining. We were lucky to have her as the designer for The Lost Words, luckier still that she helped to shape this project.I hope people who are patients of the ROH find peace in the images on the walls. I know the education program there have plans to use the walls in their work, which makes me glad. This isn’t my work. It’s mine and Alison’s. Together I hope we can go on to do other things.Below is my favourite image. The heron and the moon are from The Lost Words. Some of the willow boughs are from the kingfisher page, coloured by Alison, some from the new work. And the breeze blows gently through the boughs.The dark seemed to come early, outside the mullioned windows of a city pub where I drank herb tea in the afternoon with Robin. City lights, the edge of winter and a curious numbness that descends before an event. Often this is a time for quiet contemplation, but in this case it was sound checks, stage managing, and here, Robert making sure I draw things in the right way and don’t make too much mess.But this wasn’t an ordinary event. This was a fundraising event for Sobell House Hospice, to hopefully bring the art from The Lost Words into the walls of the new wing of the hospice.The event had grown, in the same way the crowdfunding for books into schools had grown, from a tweet. Robert Macfarlane had tweeted about hospice architecture and mentioned, in passing, that he and I had begun work, with designer Alison O’toole, on the artwork for four floors of the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in London. Rachel Clarke saw this, and knowing how the book was being used to help patients in the hospice she works at find peace, a voice, escape she got in touch. And so together the three of us planned.Around 500 people joined us in the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford, to talk about art, writing, nature, life and death. I’m still trying to understand what happened next. It wasn’t like being on stage.We talked a little about the book, its genesis, and some of its wild life, the connection first made between Robert and Rachel, that lynches upon a stone from the Arctic circle, that fits and sits in the palm of a hand and carries with it a deep time in every sense of the word. Joe, who paints birds, spoke, words shared with strangers, precious moments of his life shared as he is so close to the end of his life and how he shines. Such a beautiful man, and such life in his paintings. God but how lucky we all were who shared those moments with him. And Valerie’s daughter. Valerie who has written her own words, illustrated utterly beautifully by her grandchildren, to make the genesis of a family book, a treasure, and how she wrote of the joy of life in a feathered thing. And Ed. Ed who teaches children to see such beauty in the world. His words are shared here, so that those not fortunate enough to be in the audience can share a celebration of a life and a love.What made this special? The music, both Kerry’s and Diane’s, woven around Robert’s words, Diane’s words. Rachel, whose fierce intelligence and desire to help people live to the last moment, orchestrated the evening. The coming together of people to celebrate life and the wilder world. The strong feeling of hope that thrummed through the room like sap through trees. That warmth. And outside the city buzzed with commerce but in that space, for a moment it seemed it was time to stop, take stock, move forward with life. Did others feel it so? Did everyone there take away something different?I think it was good that there was a reception at Blackwells afterwards and can I give a huge thank you to Blackwells for donating a percentage of sales to the hospice. Thanks to all who bought at the auction.I would love to hear what others thought of the event, how it left them, what they took away. Do others feel that connection with the natural world that stills the heart, drops away the tensions, lifts the soul? I come back again to that brief moment in time, watching a sparrowhawk take out a small song from the sky as it hunted. It’s not that the natural world is a benign blanket to wrap up in. It’s fierce, can be deadly, and yet always it is the trees I turn to, the birds, weather, the sound of wild water in the form of rain, river or sea. Do others feel like that? Please tell me.These words haunted me through the evening, by Raymond Carver, and then, later.And did you get whatyou wanted from this life, even so?I did.And what did you want?To call myself beloved, to feel myselfbeloved on the earth.”We wanted to leave the audience with a gift. I had asked Chris Jelley if he could put a film together with the music for the bluebell song by Kerry Andrew. The beauty of Kerry’s voice entwined with Robert’s words is wonderful. I find myself returning again and again to the peace of it. Do listen with headphones.Bluebell Spell – The Lost Words from Christopher Jelley on Vimeo.And what was that evening about? Partly to raise money for the artwork to be on the hospital walls. The costs arise in printing and design as Robert and I are donating the words and the images. But mostly to celebrate the work of the hospice, the love and the light.If you were there can you tell me, what did you take away from the night?Blog this!

 Tell a friendIt feels a little as if I have stepped out of time. This year has been such a round of being at home, being away. And sometimes if I feel I have to pinch myself to see if I am dreaming it’s hardly a surprise.I grew up in Evesham and Broadway, not so far from Oxford, but never went there until I was much older. Last October I found myself beneath a T-rex, signing books with Robert Macfarlane. We had just finished a talk at the Natural History Museum in Oxford.Just over a year on and we are back, but this time we are in the Sheldonian Theatre. Oxford always seems a little surreal to me.What an amazing venue. Like walking into the very best parts of a Philip Pullman book.The event is a fund raising event for Sobell House hospice, and Robert and I will be talking to Dr Rachel Clarke, woman of genius, with a big heart, the biggest, about hope, love, the power of the connection to all that is natural in the world, about life, death and words. Spells will be spoken and otters painted and there will be songs inspired by The Lost Words. Kerry Andrew’s beautiful Bluebell song will be played, so haunting, and we hope that the evening will be a place of peace.Tickets are still available, priced at £8, with a hope that people might donate towards the movement to bring artwork from The Lost Words into the new annex at Sobell House. Already the money has been raised to provide copies of the book to every hospice in Britain. ( The money is to pay for design and printing and installation only.)After the event there will be an auction of artwork and book signing in Blackwell’s Bookshop.It’s hard to know what to say about this event. I met Rachel in Hay on Wye during the festival in May. She is an amazing woman. She is a passionate advocate for the NHS. She has so many stories bound up inside her.Still a few tickets left to join @RobGMacfarlane & @JackieMorrisArt in Oxford’s Sheldonian Theatre, 7pm, Fri 23 Nov, discussing nature, joy, hope, wonder, life, death and #TheLostWords. In aid of @sobellhouse. Please join us! ?????
Tickets here: https://t.co/Cal8cKA51p pic.twitter.com/86S9QtG8y6— Rachel Clarke (@doctor_oxford) November 10, 2018I don’t think I can describe the event, and I don’t think there will ever be another like it, so please come, if you can, and please tell people who live near by, or those who might wish to travel to be there. Oxford is such a wonderful place to visit. There’s also the Spellbound exhibition on in the Ashmoleum Museum.Hope and wonder. Joy. Ink, otters, words. We will do our best.Today I ground some pigment, Bideford black again, mixed with water from Dulverton leat and painted some hares.These are all for sale for the Crowdfunder in Devon. The pigment is so dark, and I am still trying to get the mix of gum arabic right with it. Going to try soon mixing with egg yolk, and also with egg white to see if the sheen is different. There’s something rather lovely about making your own paint. I also have some Velour a sauce, that I want to play with, both with a stump and also maybe with gum arabic and water. I have one tube of the velour, at least 200 years old, a test tube of fine, dark powder that was in the old paints I bought in an antique shop in Llandeillo. It’s beautiful, a glass vial with a cork in the end. Almost full, but not quite, so it must have spoken years ago for someone else.Anyway, the hares are £200 pounds each.25 x 10cms.Email me to secure before donating, stating which hare you want, with Hare in subject title.Hare below now sold.Two hares below have now sold.Hare below is now sold.The photo above shows all of them together for easier comparison, and the one below is me thinking aloud with ideas of composition.Robert and I are hearing wonderful stories of amazing generosity, with people offering to help deliver books to save money on delivery so that more books can be bought.Email me to secure a hare before donating. And if you wish to contribute any amount to the crowdfunder you can do so here.WebsiteGalleryGinger CatsAdam Buick Ceramics

News 3I would like to welcome you to our website. It is a ‘window to the school’ and we hope that it is accessible and that you enjoy the view. The website is important and will strengthen the link between the school and home. Through its content you get to understand what The Jane Lane School is trying to achieve for its children and young people.I feel incredibly privileged to lead such a wonderful school. At The Jane Lane School, we strive to be person-centred. We take pride in the warmth of our community in which all of our pupils feel valued. We also recognise that exam results matter and our students consistently achieve well in comparison to similar schools in surrounding Authorities.The Jane Lane School is an exceptionally special place; a school which believes in the unlimited potential of every child and young person, where they come first and is ultimately a place where every child can be successful. Our tradition of success is built on high quality teaching and learning and, most importantly, the value we place on the very special relationships between pupils and staff.We are an aspirational school. We aspire to achieve extraordinary results continuously. We challenge ourselves to learn from today so that we can make tomorrow better. This reflects our commitment to the ‘aggregation of marginal gains‘ where everything that goes into school improvement is identified and each element is improved in small increments so that collectively significant improvement in performance is achieved. It is a philosophy of thinking small in order to achieve big. We focus on progress.The way we do things is incredibly important to us. The emphasis on cultivating strong relationships, developing independence, having fun, encouraging creativity and embracing curiosity allows our students to flourish in an environment that is tightly focused on learning.The website cannot fully capture the spirit of our school. The only way to get a feel for what we believe in and how we do things is to come for a visit and meet the people that make the school such a special place.I look forward to meeting you.If you require further information about The Jane Lane School, please contact us and we will do our best to help.Tony Milovsorov

Hello and welcome to the corner of cyberspace formerly occupied by the language school/training company that was JMJ Training & Development. It has now become the personal website of that organisation’s founder, Georgina Kirk. If you’ve arrived here on purpose because you know me, thank you for looking me up. The main reason for keeping the domain name was so I could keep the email address associated with it (georgie@), so do please get in touch and tell me what you’ve been up to. If you’ve arrived here directed by a search engine, you are equally welcome and I hope you’ll find something here to interest you. No more language-teaching, I’m afraid, but lots in the area of communication (see below).Effective communication has always been a passion of mine. I’m interested in language, in foreign languages and in how humans interact with each other. I’m also fascinated by the psychological side of how we express ourselves and relate to others. In the years since I closed JMJ to go travelling, I’ve learnt an enormous amount about myself and the world and my plan is to explore on this website some of the insights and ideas that have come to me, in case anyone reading may find them useful.Currently, I’m excited about the concept that, to a great extent, fear is fear, regardless of its cause, and thus overcoming it in one area can help reduce it in other areas. What I mean is, if I’m afraid of heights, of the dark and of conflict, tackling one of these can help me with all of them. I’m testing this hypothesis by challenging myself in a variety of ways – and I’ll report back on the results ?What prompted this research was partly having been through a quite severe depression and wanting to identify ways of helping other people whose lives are afflicted by mental illness and anxiety (fear is only one aspect of this but it’s one of the fundamentals). The parallel impetus is that I’m constantly exhorting my clients to push themselves and to face down their demons and I want to deepen my understanding of the mechanics of fear, so as to be able to offer them better and better advice.I no longer teach languages: the aforementioned clients are being coached in public speaking, lecturing, training, how to make an impact and the right impression at an interview, a business pitch, in a debate or discussion or any other type of meeting. I have other websites to reflect all this:Put Yourself Across brings together all the interwoven aspects of what I do as a consultant and coach in effective communication.Public Speaking Skills has grown into a pretty hefty resource for anyone looking for help with making a speech or presentation.Effective Teaching and Training addresses the teaching, training and lecturing side of what I do. This site needs more work, as and when time allows, but I’m particularly pleased with the ebook I wrote to accompany it, 22 Top Tips for Teachers, Trainers and Lecturers. I put a great deal of thought and care into it and I like to think it’s really useful for anyone who teaches, trains or lectures to adults. (My ebook about public speaking is useful too but I’m in the process of reworking and expanding it into a physical book I’ll be publishing in 2018.)As well as a coach and consultant, I have become what they call a motivational speaker. I like to refer to my talks as stand-up psychology, but motivational speaking is the term with most currency. Alongside How to Be Perfect… in your own way (to which the above link connects), the other talk I present regularly is Life Lessons from Public Speaking.Something huge I’ve achieved since closing JMJ is joining The Magic Circle. I’ve always wanted to be a member of that august institution and I could not be more proud and excited that I’ve managed it – though most of the credit must go to Iain Moran, a world-class magician and my great friend and mentor.I’m developing a talk about The Magic of Communication, which will illustrate points about effective communication through demonstrations of magic, but that won’t be ready for a while.That’s how things stand at the moment. Life is good ?" 64131.0 0.0 "JMJ Manchester"

Commissioned Paintings, Sun Catchers, Fine Art Prints, Jewellery, Printable CollageWelcome to my new, updated web site. I am an artist and creator of beautiful things. Since retiring I have had time to indulge my love of arts and crafts, I have painted for many years and now have the time to paint commissions. Most of these have been painted for gifts (usually surprises) and it's so rewarding when they are received with joy and loved. You can see some examples on my commissions page.I also make handcrafted copper wire necklaces, sterling silver wire woven and wrapped necklaces, pendants and bracelets and handmade gold filled wire jewellery, wrapping and weaving in Swarovski crystals and gemstones. These are usually one of a kind pieces and are available in my Jewellery Shop.Seeing how Swarovski crystals catch and reflect the light I thought it would be good to use the skills I learned making jewellery to make suncatchers so I have designed some of these. They look amazing when the sun shines through creating rainbows around the room.I hope you enjoy browsing through my web site. Please contact me if you would like further information on anything on the web site.If you would like to be kept informed of new ranges or blog posts please sign up to my newsletter, you will find a form for this at the bottom of the page. I guarantee I will never share your email address with anyone without your permission so you won't receive any unwanted emails and can unsubscribe at any time.JoyLooking for a one of a kind handcrafted gift ?

Og for sjette år i træk afholdes årets Comedy Aid i samarbejde med Red Barnet. FBI og komikerne donerer dermed igen i år overskuddet fra showet til organisationens vigtige humanitære arbejde for børn på flugt og i krigsramte områder. Billetter og info på: www.fbi.dk/comedy-aid/Fredag d. 8. juni 2018 blev der skrevet en artikel om Dansk KFUK i Skoleogliv.Journalisten Caroline Bjerkan har i samarbejde med Karina Schmidt fra Dansk KFUK lavet et portræt om dét hus som mange danskere kender i London.

It was also a rather early start for the band as we were drawn number 4 from 17 bands but the early start proved fruitful as we were awarded 3rd place in the Open Competition. The playing programme consisted of the popular street march Ravenswood (William Rimmer), a beautiful hymn tune arrangement titled Prelude on ‘Lavenham’ (arr. Nobes) and the challenging test piece work of Philip Sparke’s Dances and Alleluias. Next up for the band is the eagerly awaited Annual Concert which is being held on Friday 17th November in Bo’ness Town Hall.Full Results:

Tobacco by itself is harmless. It is incredibly dangerous to us when we harvest it and smoke the leaves in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, and use it as chewing tobacco. Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of heart and lung disease, stroke, high blood disease, various types of cancer, the most prominent being lung cancer, and COPD. COPD is basically a near total shutdown of the ability of the lungs to bring in oxygen, which is akin to not breathing.Before World War II, lung cancer was almost unheard of in America, and with the rising popularity of smoking during and after the war, lung cancer statistics shot up through the roof during the 1950’s and 1960’s and have always been correlated with smoking since that time.When it comes right down to it, a person might just as well back up the family car and hook the exhaust up to their mouth and breathe deeply. The result will be the same, it is just that the car exhaust technique will simply occur earlier. That may sound rather harsh, but smoking cigarettes does pretty much the same thing to our bodies. Our bodies are simply poisoned by cigarette smoke.Did you know that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide and cyanide? Both of these substances will kill you, and yet we think nothing of inhaling both of these in cigarette smoke. Did you know that nicotine is also a killer? If you were subjected to an amount of nicotine the size of the head of a pin, you would be dead instantly. So, it is just a matter of the amount of the poison we consume at one time, that keeps us alive, but we will suffer from the effects of it just the same.Lung cancer is nearly totally derived from cigarette smoking. The carcinogens that are found in the smoke of cigarettes have been shown in studies to bind to the DNA in our bodies and cause genetic mutations at the cellular level, possible being a factor in the formation of cancers. Roughly 95% of lung cancer patients have been smokers of either cigarettes or cigars. Once lung cancer passes a certain stage, it is almost always fatal, unless caught early and is limited in scope, to where the affected part of the lung can be removed.Cigarette smoke destroys the alveoli of the lung to the point that they become very hard and inelastic to the point that they cease to function. The alveoli are the method that is used by our lungs to transfer oxygen from the air breathed in to the blood in our bodies. Without that process working properly, we will die. When the alveoli cease to function properly, it is called COPD.The nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive, making cessation of smoking very difficult, if not impossible to stop. Since smoke is a major cause of nearly all of our degenerative diseases, it doesn’t seem logical that a person would continue. Nearly all of the long-term smokers will die of some form of disease caused by smoking. That alone is an excellent incentive to stop smoking tobacco.Many people have switched to electronic cigarettes where they can lower how much nicotine they use slowly weaning down to 0mg. It is a very effective way of quitting and we do recommend using eliquid and electronic cigarettes." 66606.0 0.0 "Kitty Mania E-Liquid"

Historic Sailing Vessel CharterSpend a day or evening on a historic wooden sailing vessel built in 1923, the Thames Sailing Barge Lady Daphne, and have Tower Bridge raised especially for you during your trip.S. B. Lady Daphne is one of the most famous of London’s classic wooden vessels still sailing. She was one of the many thousands of Thames sailing barges built for the English coastal trade.  Now there are fewer than 40 barges left in Britain, and fewer than 10 wooden barges with passenger certificates.  You can live history by spending a day on Lady Daphne, as it was during her working life. Imagine life as it was, on board one of thousands of red-sailed ships dominating London’s skyline in the days before road transport took over.“Laden deep with sugar, with barley, sand or coke,spitties keep on sailin, they were built of English oak.But their day is passing, fewer with each tide,grace old London’s river, London may their rare charm abide.”Poem, origin unknownPrivate HireAddress:Sea Laurel Ltd, 40C West End, March, Cambs, PE15 8DL.Email :Sam on    sam@lady-daphne.co.ukAndy on : andy@lady-daphne.co.ukMobile Phone:Sam 07795590621Andy 07798635872" 67174.0 0.0 "Lady Daphne – Historic Sailing Vessel Charter"

Our General Data Protection Regulations Privacy Notice can be found hereMore and more each day we are spending a good deal of time on the phone with people who are reporting running issues with their Lambretta (or Vespa).In most cases when we quiz and probe, a comon theme is not using your Lambretta often enough to keep the fuel fresh and new.  With more and more ethonal being addded to modern fuels this is causing us two strokers more issues.
IF you are experiencing poor starting, poor running and over heating issues, and you fuel is one to two months older, considering flushing your fuel system and putting fresh fuel in.  If it is even older then this, chances are you need to clean your carb out as well.
Adding a good quality fuel treatment is at present becoming a necassity for us, especially as we dont tend to use our pride and joys every day.  The more casual rider popping down to the club meeting once a week or month, may not cover many miles and thus fill up a lot less.  Adding this fuel treatment will help no end to prolonging the life of your fuel, engine as well as you suffering less running problems.
If you want a more indepth look into the issues of modern fuel, read on..........
Three major facts on why Ethonal affects us:-
1) Ethonal attracts water : This has many issues for us, because ethonal is a hydroscopic, it will absorb water into our petrol tanks, carbs etc.  Thus the older your fuel the more of an issue this is.  Back firing, running high, poor starting, over heating can be cauased, and when we look further afield, rusting of the petrol tank internally will not be helped with the presance of water.
2) Ethonal has a different octane rating :  This can give a few differing issues, but if you have a higher compression head, your timing is too advanced, or you run higher tuned engines it will affect you more.  If your engine is set up to compensate for these issues, and the fuel does go off and your octane rating drops, then again the same running issues we have mentioned before can occur.  On the other side of the coin, if your engine has not been built with the higher octane ratings in consideration, you might find over heating (usually shown by blowing a hole in the piston, blowing a gasket, things coming looes throug extra heat expansion, can affect you and your scooter.
3) Ethonal is a solvent: Being a solvent can have many affects.  We need oil in our two stroke enggines for lubrication, oils protects our moving parts.  Ethonal can flush and wash this out, while most modern oil manufactures have compensated for this, some older or lower quality oils offer less resistance.  Oil seals, gaskets, seals, and rubber can all be affected by ethonal.  Again most modern materials have been manufactured with this in mind, but some parts can be affected.
As Ethanol is a solvent, it can breakdown sludge and deposits in the fuel system, releasing them to flow throughout the engine, but a bigger effect is inside the carburettor. Our carbs have very small holes in jets that become clogged and harm engine performance.IF you are experiencing poor starting, poor running and over heating issues, and you fuel is one to two months older, considering flushing your fuel system and putting fresh fuel in.

Royal Leamington Spa became a borough in 1875 and the Charter of Incorporation, together with the Grant of Arms made the following year, are now housed in two handsome cabinets presented to the town by the Leamington Spa Courier.Following the abolition of the Borough of Royal Leamington Spa by the Local Government Act, 1972, custody of the civic insignia was given to the Charter Trustees, a duty undertaken until the grant of Town Council status in 2002. The Town Council is now the custodian of this historic legacy.The Town Council of Royal Leamington Spa,

Tempory holding page untill we get Drupal sorted :)Computer Forensics - Gareth LapworthROOM CHANGE: KE 215 - Same floor as the entrance.The meetings are normallly held at the University Of Leicester, in seminar room 527 (or sometimes the room next door) in the Ken Edwards Building. The room is on the 5th floor, but the building entrance is on the second floor, so this is not as high as it sounds.
The Ken Edwards Building is now more visible from the outside as the ""School of Management"" building.There is a campus map at http://www2.le.ac.uk/maps/campusaccess.pdf which marks the KE building. The main entrance to the building is next to the Percy Gee building (students' union).By 7pm parking should not be too much of a problem, although the entrance barriers may still be down (tell the security guard you have a meeting in the Ken Edwards building, and they should let you in OK). Entrance 1 (by Cannons Health club) or 2 (Mayors walk) are the ones that should be used.There is a web page with details of how to get to the campus:
  
  http://www2.le.ac.uk/maps/Thanks to Gilbert Laycock for booking us the room, and we hope to see you all there.The following times are approximate guidelines.7pm-7.30pm Machine set up and problem solving, general chatting, and introductions.

						Green kitchen: new wave cooking
The eco credentials of microwave recipes

				

					Richard Ehrlich
		
						At the Abergavenny Food Festival last month, I gave a joint demonstration on low-energy cooking with Jennipher Marshall-Jenkinson, chairman of the Microwave Technologies Association. My spiel was about pressure cookers. No prizes for guessing what Marshall-Jenkinson talked about.

						Among the dishes she cooked was a steamed toffee pudding which took all of seven minutes (and looked and tasted great). And watching her work made me think about two semi-imminent events. One is Energy Saving Week, which runs from October 20-26. The other is Christmas. Since you may already be planning on cooking your Christmas pudding, Marshall-Jenkinson and I both plead: cook it in your microwave.

					Marguerite Patten, Britain’s senior cookery writer and a long-time microwave advocate, has published a microwave Christmas pudding recipe that calls for ten minutes of cooking. According to an analysis for Defra, cooking Christmas pud on an electric hob uses somewhere between 7.5 and 10 times more electricity than cooking it in a microwave.

					What does that mean for the nation? Look at it this way: for every 10,000 Christmas puddings cooked from scratch in the microwave, we eliminate around 26,000 kWh of electricity use – enough to run 250 full-size dishwashers twice a week for a year. We also save tens of thousands of litres of water. And these savings increase if the pud is then heated for serving in the microwave. Similar savings can be made cooking rather more everyday dishes such as baked potatoes in the microwave.

						Learn more about Energy Saving Week at http://tinyurl.com/54d7gs. Marshall-Jenkinson’s excellent book Microwave Magic: The Art of 21st Century Cooking (£12.95) can be purchased at www.microwaveassociation.org.uk .

When someone dies and leaves assets which have to be dealt with either in terms of their Will or under the rules of intestate succession (where there is no Will) an executor must be appointed and, unless the assets are very modest, in most cases an executor employs a Solicitor to act as his agent..In a rural area, it is natural that we deal with farms, small holdings and crofts whether in connection with transfer or inheritance or marketing. Crofting is a specialised area in which many Solicitors in the Highland Area can claim expertise..The basic conveyancing procedures for commercial properties are much the same as for residential properties but naturally, the value of a shop, hotel, public house, farm, or factory may be considerably higher..This is the technical term for the procedure for the transfer of heritable property that is any land whether with or without a house or other building on it and also the creation of a security or mortgage deed over the property for a lender..A civil court action is sometimes the only solution to resolve matters both personal and business. Most civil court matters concern either a contract between two or more parties or a wrong caused by one party to another either deliberately or negligently..Eldon LeaBeautiful one and a half storey detached house in a quiet elevated location on the edge of the villa....Read more..£345,000Content Copyright © Middleton Ross & Arnot 2013.

The premier union for teachers in England and Wales.CAMPAIGNS UPDATEParents, schools and councillors unite against SEND funding cutsOn Tuesday 23 October the School Cuts coalition delivered a petition signed by more than 34,000 people to the Department for Education (DfE), demanding more funding for children and young people with SEND in schools. The hand in was live streamed to supporters on Facebook Live and covered widely on social media and in the local press. Watch the live stream footage (skip to 22:00 mins to see the DfE send out an official to collect the petition).We were joined on the day by more than 60 people, including representatives from the NEU, ASCL, NAHT and Unison, as well as a number of SEND parent groups and teacher activists. Several local councillors joined us at the event to highlight the pressure local authorities face through cuts to their local services for children with SEND, and marched with us under banners displaying the message “parents, schools and councillors united against the #SENDcrisis”.Before the petition was delivered, School Cuts hosted a well-attended briefing where speakers from the unions addressed the crowd, including NEU joint general secretary Mary Bousted, ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton, Unison head of education Jon Richards, and former NAHT president Anne Lyons, demanding a fair deal for our SEND children. We were also joined by Labour MPs Mike Kane, Emma Hardy and James Frith, as well as education spokesperson for the Green Party, Vix Lowthion, who gave rousing speeches about the importance of providing a good education for all.The fight for fair SEND funding isn’t over now the petition has been delivered. With the early announcement of the budget on Monday, the NEU, NAHT and ASCL have jointly set six tests for the Chancellor that we hope the budget will pass.Share the joint union six tests on Twitter and Facebook to spread the word and to hold the Chancellor to account.We are encouraging supporters to email their MPs before the Budget on the 29 October, asking them to pledge to support the school cuts six tests for the Budget.  You can email your MP in less than 30 seconds.ACTIONPlease find below details of forthcoming action*.

Unhelpfully, however, the Data Protection Act 2018 provides an exemption from disclosure of confidential references for both the employer supplying the reference and the prospective employer receiving it.Therefore, both employers may refuse a disclosure request. We should continue to advise members seeking the disclosure of their job references to make a subject access request either to the referee or to the recipient, or to both. However, they should be warned that neither are obliged to acquiesce. Furthermore, where an access request is denied, members should be advised to ask (in writing) for the reasons why their request was denied. A complaint may be made to the ICO if no response is forthcoming, or the response implies the employer is operating a blanket policy.It is good practice to share the content of references with employees before sending them. If you have not already done so, you are encouraged to negotiate this good practice with employers in your area. In the meantime, the NEU guidance on references is being updated on the legacy website to reflect this unhelpful change in the lawINTERNATIONALNominations open for Steve Sinnott International Solidarity AwardNominations are now open for the 2019 Steve Sinnott International Solidarity Award, which recognises members who have made exemplary contributions to the Union’s work on international solidarity.

Listen from 5:15 here. Mary also did the rounds of BBC Local Radio afternoon shows, 13 in total, on the same subject.In the afternoon our SEND petition – signed by 34,000 people as part of the School Cuts campaign – was delivered to the Department for Education (see Campaigns section). It was strongly picked up in the press, not just by the Daily Mail, TES and Morning Star but also 300 local reports thanks to the Press Association.Also this week the OECD published its Equity in Education report, focusing on barriers to social mobility. We were quoted in Nursery World, Morning Star, Schools Week and TES.Elsewhere we commented on the pass rate for chartered teacher status in Schools Week, an increase in school absences for Press Association, the numbers of teacher trainees on bursaries who do not then teach in state schools (The Times £), prosecutions against the owners of an illegal school in West London for the I and MSN News, and mental health amongst NQTS for the Independent. Ros McNeil also contributed to a Guardian report on SEND exclusions.And finally we are proud to have signed up to two calls for funding ahead of the Budget. The first was led by the National Children’s Bureau, who brought 120 organisations together in the name of children’s services (Morning Star, Children and Young People Now), and this was followed on Thursday by the Raise the Rate campaign for sixth form education funding.

Milkcap Mania is the UK's premier milkcap/pog/tazo website, including scans of many milkcaps, pogs and tazos. Use the Menu on the right hand side of the page to navigate the site.Milkcaps/pogs/tazos are basically circles of card with images on that are collectable and also used as a game. Milkcaps is the generic term used to describe them, but they are also well known as Pogs, Tazos or Flippos. There are many different makes and styles of milkcaps, although this site features mainly POG milkcaps, Slammer Whammers and Krome Kaps.If you are new to milkcaps/pogs/tazos, please see below for the story of how pogs were created and what they are. You can also check out the guide to playing milkcaps/pogs/tazos, the guide to slamming techniques, and the guide to pog storage.If you would like to contribute to the site you can register as a member and will then have the ability to edit the information on each milkcap/pog/tazo page.Also, if you have some Pogs, Tazos, Flippos, etc. that you would like to scan to send me so I can add them to the website, this would be appreciated. However, before scanning them you might want to contact us first to check whether I already have a scan of them or not. I already have most of my collection scanned, but only part of it is currently on the website, so I don't want to waste your time scanning something if I've already got it. Scans should be at 300DPI. Preferably saved as a .png file for maximum quality, though this might result in a file size too large for emailing, so jpg/jpeg is fine too.31st December 2018Happy new year!

The top of each bottle had a small round cardboard lid or cap.
        Times were hard in Hawaii - despite the warm sunshine, fabulous beaches and all the coconuts you could eat The 1930s were the years of the Great Depression. Thousands of people lost their jobs and they had no money to spend on new toys.
        Children had to make their own games. And that's when the caps off the juice drinks caught someone's eye. Soon a game sprang up, invented entirely by children. The idea was to flip the bottle caps. These became known as POGs because the ingredients of the drink were Passion fruit, Orange and Guava.The kids drew designs on the caps and also made slammers. These slammers were usually three caps glued together. They called them kinis - the Hawaiian word for 'king'.
        The craze lasted a number of years but eventually faded away. It would probably have dissapeared forever if it hadn't been for a school teacher, Blossom Galbiso. She had played POGs with all her friends when she was growing up in the 1930s. In 1991 she decided to teach the game to the pupils in her class.They loved it and told the others in the school, who told all their friends in other schools. Once again the whole of Hawaii was going mad for POGs. The game was bigger than ever before. In fact, by 1992 it was reckoned that the average child in Hawaii had a collection of 1,700 POGs.
        In 1993 POGs flipped over to mainland America. First California, then one by one all the other states caught on to the craze. National tournaments were organised and other makes of caps were invented to cope with the demand.POGs were launched in the UK at the beginning of 1995, and over 30 million caps have been sold here since. After about 1996 the cap craze started to die, which is a shame as it is such a great game. Maybe in another 70 years the game will be revived and start a massive craze again.

Founded in 1982, the Trust was set up to restore, distribute and promote the ministry of the late Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981).The ‘Doctor’, as he was affectionately known, is recognised by many to have been one of the finest British preachers of the twentieth century and was minister of Westminster Chapel, London, from 1938 until 1968.His ministry was based on the clear and systematic teaching and preaching of the Bible, and it was this that has earned him the respect and affection of many throughout the world. It’s our prayer that through the ministry of the Trust a new generation will once again discover the importance and the value of expository preaching.Many people who would remember The Doctor will now be close to or actually retired and collecting a pension.Secondary to dedicating this website to the Doctor we are keen on ensuring those who have retired are secure in their later years and not victims of pension mis-selling.Missold Pensions occur when financial advisors act in their own interests rather than those of their clients.They put high commissions first and often the pension product is rare suitable for the consumer.The biggest misselling occurred with Missold SIPPs. This is a Self Invested Personal Pension which allows the pension holder to handle their own investments. It is an ideal product for sophisticated investors but this led to misselling and lots of people were not experienced enough. Thus they have ended up loosing the mortify and in worse cases all of their savings.There are many claims management companies that can assist victims to recover their savings but consumers should fully research all angles before agreeing to their assistance.As a retiree myself, I lost money in relation to SERPs as I opted out of contributions.As well as this, an element of my pension was placed into a SIPP investment relating to storage pods and car park investments.I recently found these were missold to me.Part of my work in creating this website, will be dedicated to ensuring fellow retirees like me do not get missold investments.As this website will attract people of a similar age, I feel its a great platform to make such announcements.We hope you find this news informative and our work dedicated to saving the memory of ‘The Doctor’ is appreciated.A book is available to buy called The Doctor Himself and the Human Condition. The chapters included in this book are a representative selection of the various papers and addresses given over many years to medical practitioners and students by David Martyn LloydJones. Some of them are published here for the first time.Although they were originally addressed to a medical audience, the subjects dealt with here are not strictly medical in a clinical sense, but rather represent the author’s thinking on the way in which Biblical Christianity should be applied to questions of personal conduct and morality as well as to professional conduct and ethics.The appeal of this book is therefore not only to doctors and students and others working within the medical profession, but also to all Christians who are seeking to apply Biblical teaching to the problems of modern living. Although some of the addresses were given nearly thirty years ago, the principles which the author lays down are equally applicable today, and his analysis of the issues discussed pays tribute to his acute and discriminating mind.Originally published by:Christian Medical Fellowship Publications

The number of lenders who provide remortgages
                  and mortgages for people with credit problems is limited. There are just a handful of lenders who will help
                  people with CCJs, defaults, mortgage arrears, discharged bankrupts
                  and
                  individuals with a poor credit score or bad credit rating.The adverse, sub-prime or bad credit mortgage industry as it’s often known has certainly come out of the shadows in the last few years. A decade ago it was a byword for unscrupulous brokers charging high fees and lenders bending over backwards with tantalising offers.
                 Before the credit crunch in 2007 there was a
                broad range of competitively priced products, less punitive and more innovative in terms of deals.
                  However, in the past few years the market has changed and
                  lenders have become increasingly wary about lending to people with
                  less than perfect credit history.Having a poor credit rating can be a deflating and traumatic experience, whatever the reason. But there
                  may be deals out there for you whether you're a first time buyer or moving home. Specialist lenders offer what are known as credit repair deals. Here, you will have to pay a higher interest rate than you would with a conventional
                deal and put down a sizeable deposit. However, once you have maintained your payments on one of these
                deals for a sufficient period (usually about three years) your credit history
                  may be in a better position to remortgage back on to a high street deal and reap the benefits of more competitive rates.People often find it useful to contact a mortgage broker who has
                experience in the area of adverse credit lending and non standard
                mortgages. You can do this by simply completing the no
                obligation contact form on this website. There are a few specialist lenders out there and they get most of their business through
                brokers.A truly independent broker will look at your
                individual circumstances and find the best mortgage for you.
                They may be able to help you find a
                mortgage even if you have been turned down elsewhere.Each enquiry will be dealt with by an experienced advisor in
                a constructive and sympathetic manner. Even if you have County Court
                Judgements, credit card defaults, loan defaults, mortgage or
                rent arrears, bankruptcy, IVA, are self-employed or have
                difficulty proving your income, there may be suitable products
                  available for you.Just get in touch with a broker, tell the broker about your situation,
                  and let them do
                the hard work.Whatever your credit history, click here

To Michael Taylor Instagram profileThe images shown in the Works section of this permanent exhibition site represent a selection of Michael's oil paintings produced since leaving Goldsmiths College School of Art in 1974.Most of the works depicted here have been exhibited at various exhibitions and galleries including The Royal Academy of Arts, Beaux Arts (London and Bath), The National Portrait Gallery, and most recently at Waterhouse and Dodd (London), and have been acquired by private or public collections including:Awards include:For enquiries about available works for sale, please contact Jamie (jamie@waterhousedodd.com) at Waterhouse and Dodd, 47 Albermarle Street, London W1S 4JW.Seated Figure with Cycle Helmet is to be shown at a mixed exhibition to celebrate Dorset Art Weeks at Kelly Ross's The Art Stable, Child Okeford, Dorset.Figure with Box is currently on display at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters annual exhibition at the Mall Galleries, London, where it was awarded the Smallwood Architects Prize for 'contextual portraiture'.I first saw Korean Ch'aekorri still life paintings while visiting my son there last year. The heavy symbolism, distinctive colours and strange inverted perspective had a strong effect on me, and has consequently begun seep into some of my recent work.Waterhouse and Dodd will be presenting five new works at the gallery in February 2015. The rear of the gallery will feature a selection of  work curated by Michael from gallery stock, including  further oil paintings and works on paper by the artist.The National Portrait Gallery's drawing, Self Portrait (in memory of my father), is to be shown as part of an exhibition devoted to self portraiture at Turner Contemporary, Margate. Opening on 25th January, and organized jointly with the NPG, 'Self: Image and Identity: Self-portraiture from Van Dyck to Louise Bourgeois' is being staged to showcase their newly acquired Van Dyck self portrait.Film director Wes Anderson approached me in 2012 to paint a fictional Re­nais­sance portrait to be titled 'Boy with Apple' for his next film The Grand Budapest Hotel.

Intrigued by the script.....The Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham will be showing Michael's portrait of Sir John Tavener as part of a collection of portraits of 20th century composers. The exhibition, a joint project with the National Portrait Gallery titled ""Facing the Music"", will be formally opened by Michael on 24th May and will run from 25th May- 27th August 2012.Self Portrait (In Memory of my Father) was acquired by The National Portrait Gallery, London  in February, 2012.  It joins their collection of artists' self portraits.The first four months of the year have been spent creating a Self Portrait with Grave Goods (and shaving mirror). It formed the culmination of six years of non stop work which provided the content for my two one man shows at Waterhouse and Dodd, interspersed with one or two portrait commissions. I saw this self portrait, a commission from a Turkish collector, as a chance to reflect on this period and finally dump myself and a collection of redundant props and metaphoric objects in the attic tomb, and seal the entrance.This one-man show runs from 24 November until 17 December 2010 at Waterhouse & Dodd, 26 Cork Street, London W1S 3ND.   A catalogue is available from the gallery on request. For further information call Jamie Anderson at the gallery on +44 20 7734 7800.

Welcome to the United Kingdom Industrial History website. The best way for someone to learn about the course of the United Kingdom’s role in the previous century’s industrial revolution is to make use of the number of different history books available on the subject. Different authors express different viewpoints on the subject, however, so it is a good idea to read them with an awareness of their subjectivity. It can be very interesting to observe how an identical event can be described so very differently in different books, even to the extent of drawing different conclusions. Although the content of history books is always going to be factual, a result of the varying points of view of every author means that different conclusions can almost be expected. This is the reason why it is advisable to read more than one history textbook, whether you are researching the United Kingdom’s industrial heritage, or anything else for that matter. Historical textbooks often use support their interpretation through the use of various references, and it may even be a good idea for you to further study these references in order to gain a greater understanding of what actually happened.The presentation of the facts is a major variable that can affect your understanding of history. Some historical textbooks have a more reliable presentation of factual material than others. When you read different historical authors, you should pay attention to the differences between them, and draw your own conclusions. Get in touch with us here at the United Kingdom Industrial History website with all your views and feedback.Also see - custom glass productsHistory is a wonderful subject, and can enlighten and broaden our perspective upon the world in which we find ourselves. There are a broad range of history textbooks dealing with the United Kingdom’s Industrial heritage for students to peruse, and each of them provides compelling reading. The interpretation of historical events differs in different books, in the way events are described, but not in terms of facts and dates, yet the facts remain.You can send us an email if you want to know more about United Kingdom Industrial History; we will get back to you as soon as we are able.The United Kingdom Industrial History website is not related to the old My Marras website.If you would like to know more about the My Marras website please contact them directly.© Copyright 2012" 77253.0 0.0 "United Kingdom Industrial History"

All the payroll provider does is take the net wage amount from your bank account one week and pay it into
your employee bank account the next week.
For this simple exercise some payroll providers want to charge you hundreds of pounds per year for their
version of a premium payroll service.
We do not sell you services that you may not require and do not offer a transfer of wages service, from your bank account to your employee bank account saving you hundreds of pounds per year compared
to other payroll provider services.
All you need do is simply set up a direct debit with your bank to pay your employee each pay day


Other expensive add-ons you avoid when subscribing to Nannywage Ltd.
Employer Liability Insurance Our advice of first checking your home contents insurance to see if
employer liability cover is included, may save you the £100 premium per year for employer liability
insurance cover, that some payroll providers may try to sell to you.
Our Full year subscription guarantee, which ensures that you receive a full year subscription,
regardless of the amount of employees or tax years this takes to complete for a current PAYE scheme.
When an employee leaves, your subscription is put on hold and resumes whenever the next nanny starts in
your employment. Some payroll providers charge per calendar year, which means that if your nanny leaves
after 6 months and you employ again after your 12 months has ended, you will have to pay for a new
subscription.
You avoid this expensive subscription method, when signing up with Nannywage Ltd payroll service.We will register you for a PAYE small employer scheme with HMRC
We will produce a  Contract of employment for you and your employee if requiredEMPLOYER LIABILITY INSURANCE
          By law you are required to insure your workers against liability or disease.
You could be fined £2,500 for every day that you do not have cover.
It is vital you protect yourself from damages and costs arising from injury to staff at work.
Not only covering you from the injury but also from potential future loss of earnings.
Minimum cover should be £5 million.
 Before you purchase a policy we recommend you check with your home contents provider as in the vast majority of cases employer liability insurance cover is included in your home contents policy. The employer should also check that the nanny has insurance to cover any damage the nanny may cause in the course of employment duties.      
Nannywage Ltd do not try to sell you services that you may not require. Our advice, of first checking your home contents insurance to see if employer liability cover is included, may save you the £100 premium per year for employer liability insurance cover, that some payroll providers may try to sell to youNANNY PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE
        If the nanny is registered with a child care organisation, the nanny is normally required by that organisation to have public liability insurance. If the nanny does not belong to a child care organisation they should still insure themselves to protect against any damages or costs.

Nannywage Ltd do not have any trading agreements or introducer commission arrangements with any insurance broker or provider.
Unlike many other payroll providers we intend to remain totally independent and impartial in order to give you best advice.
Other payroll providers receive an introducer fee for selling you insurance from the insurance broker or provider adding to the cost of the policy.
Nannywage Ltd recommend no companies whatsoever, but have found over the years that Morton Michel who have been established over 50 years offer a good service.
Just search Google for their name or general search Employer Liability Insurance and Nanny public Liability insurance and then judge for yourself and save money.Nannywage Ltd 25, The Highway, Sutton, Surrey. SM2 5QT. T.020 8642 5470 Business Hours Mon-Fri 9.30AM-5PM

Another story claims that while on a long trip, King Alfonso had stopped to rest in the town of Ventorillo del Chato in the province of Cádiz, and he ordered a glass of Jerez, or Sherry. There was a gusty wind, so the inn keeper served him his glass of sherry covered by a slice of ham to prevent the sherry from getting dirty. King Alfonso apparently liked it, and when he asked for a second glass, he requested another tapa or “cover” just like the first.Enca & Paco Navarro hail from Sevilla, the capital of Andalucia.Navarro's wholesome and tasty homemade food and great wines, at the right price, attracts visitors from all over London.

Investment Trusts have been around for a long time: some of the oldest date back to the 19th century, and they're still going strong! Yet they
      are not as well-known as unit trusts, despite often performing better and with lower fees. The reason they are less familiar than unit trusts is largely because Independent 
      Financial Advisors (IFAs) were historically allowed to receive a commission from selling unit trusts, so they advised investors to buy them in preference to 
      investment trusts. Regulations introduced in 2013 abolished that practice, and now investment trusts can compete on an equal footing with unit trusts.
      Today, the investment trusts market in the UK is worth around £100 billion and rising. They represent a relatively low-risk, high-performance way of gaining exposure to the stock market.
      Read on to be part of the changing landscape of investing!Investment trusts are publicly traded companies that are listed on financial exchanges exactly like shares (equities). 
              They can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, and held in trading accounts, ISAs and SIPPs.
              In this regard they are very similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
             Funds may be listed on exchanges but are only priced once per day. They are a different asset class and need to be traded on a platform that supports them.Investment Trusts are known as ""closed-ended"" funds, because their underlying assets do not change to meet investor demand: the trust's 
             share price fluctuates instead.
             This is in contrast to funds (OEICs and unit trusts) which are ""open-ended"" and have to buy or sell underlying assets to match investors' demand.Because there is no direct correlation between investor demand for the trust and the value of the trust's underlying assets, 
             there is usually a difference between the trust's share price and the total value of its constituent assets (known at the Net Asset Value, or NAV). 
             This difference is called the discount (if negative) or premium (if positive).
             Some investors see a discounted trust as an opportunity to buy a basket of assets cheaper than they could on the open market. This comes with risk, 
             and requires due diligence.Investment trusts have on balance shown better performance than unit trusts over the long term. 
              Historically they had lower charges which helped: this reason is often still cited, but it is generally no longer true.
              The main reason is that in difficult market conditions, when the most risk-averse investors are pulling out, a unit trust is forced to sell its underlying
              assets, often at a loss, whereas an investment trust is not: it can hold tight and weather the storm.Get unique insight into the top performing investment trusts of 2018 with our free, easy to digest report. Investment trusts are a very powerful investment tool,
           but it is vital that you are in full possession of the facts. Our mission is to provide you with the data you need to make better investment decisions.

Download My Free Report NowOur report is absolutely free, so download it right now...Given the opportunities afforded by better performance, exchange trading and the ability to buy investment trusts at a discount to their
          Net Asset Value, many investors are becoming increasingly interested in these funds.
          However, as with most things in finance, with increased opportunity comes increased risk. Those trusts that invest in risky asset classes, emerging markets, 
          or use a high degree of borrowing (known as gearing) are obviously more risky than those that specialise in income-based assets such as blue chip companies 
          and goverment bonds...
          but it is more complex than that. Investors can be caught out when the trust's share price falls in relation to its NAV. What looked like a buying opportunity
          can turn into a loss when the discount to the NAV widens rather than narrowing. There are some extremely popular trusts that trade at a huge premium to their
          NAV - buying at the top of the market here could incur heavy losses if investors lose confidence in the asset class or the fund manager.For the reasons above it is vital that you are fully informed about the risks associated with each and every trust you choose to invest
           in. Of course, this is one of those things that's easy to say and harder to actually do - there are hundreds of different investment trusts out there, with 
           a wide variety of asset classes and investment philosophies, so it can be very time-consuming to trawl through them all and find the ones best suited to
           your individual needs.We are constantly analysing the market and ranking trusts in terms of performance vs. risk, and we provide in-depth data that can help you build a 
           diversified portfolio to maximise rewards while mitigating risk.We have no agenda here, we simply compare all the investment trusts on the market
                  and offer you the facts so you can be better informed in making your decision.Sick of trawling through endless tables of data? What's unique about 
                  bestinvestmenttrusts.com is the way we present our findings. We rank our findings into simple charts and graphics
                  that can be understood at a glance.We know some investors want to do more with the data, for example downloading our

We have also received The Sport England “Club Mark” for each of our club venues.We try very hard to provide the right balance for our students taking a structured approach to our teaching methodology. In this way we involve students in all aspects of judo depending on their preference and abilities.In order that individuals can train in an appropriate environment in we hold different classes on different evenings. For example, we have and continue to increase our offer to include: A competition squad training evening (Monday), a young persons coaching programme, a young persons referee and officiating programme *Two of our coaches are qualified to deliver the TOCS programme (Table Officials for Colleges and Schools), and at least one senior only evening (Wednesday and Friday).In addition to the above we try to hold an annual tournament open to all BJA clubs and associated organisations. We also hold regular mini inter schools and club competitions for mini mon competitors from the 14 schools we teach in and our 4 different venues.Our club is one big family and is aimed at the local community and we believe there are a number of benefits for both young and older people to get people involved:• Judo provides opportunities for young people to attend an established, professionally run club, run by qualified and dedicated coaches and volunteers and attended by students from different schools, different social backgrounds and different ethnic origin.• Because Judo is a contact sport it is an excellent way of integrating people from different areas of society and installing respect and discipline.• There is an ever increasing need for people to exercise and Judo is acknowledged as one of the best sports for obtaining and sustaining physical fitness in a fun way.• Judo teaches and practices one to one physical sport in a controlled and managed way with a focus on fair play and respect.• Judo is a sport where people can practice as individuals as opposed to being in a team where only the best players are included.• Judo has a structured grading system which provides the students with targets to aim for which is good for their development and personal to them.• Judo gives provides the opportunity to be the best you can in a safe environment.We are very strict in our teaching of etiquette, courtesy, respect for yourself and for others and general good behaviour.Our club is predominately a young persons development club (although we do differentiate sessions to accommodate all abilities levels), which means that through our Junior Coaches development scheme occasional sessions are taught by junior coaches under the guidance and supervision of a qualified and insured (minimum) UKCC level 2 or equivalent coach and with prior notification to parents and students alike. These sessions are only conducted under the strictest health and safety guidance.We look forward to seeing you soon!BJA London AreaNorthbrook Judo Club Promo from Magic05 Productions on VimeoNorthbrook Judo Club Promo from Magic05 Productions on VimeoNORTHBROOK KYU SHIN KAI JUDO CLUBWELCOMEWINNERS OF THE 2011 and 2013 BRITISH JUDO ASSOCIATION “CLUB OF THE YEAR!”Northbrook Kyu Shin Kai Judo club was started some 20 years ago and has grown from strength to strength ever since.We are affiliated to the British Judo Association (BJA ) and were awarded BJA club of the year 2011 and 2013.

We also hold regular mini inter schools and club competitions for mini mon competitors from the 14 schools we teach in and our 4 different venues.Our club is one big family and is aimed at the local community and we believe there are a number of benefits for both young and older people to get people involved:• Judo provides opportunities for young people to attend an established, professionally run club, run by qualified and dedicated coaches and volunteers and attended by students from different schools, different social backgrounds and different ethnic origin.• Because Judo is a contact sport it is an excellent way of integrating people from different areas of society and installing respect and discipline.• There is an ever increasing need for people to exercise and Judo is acknowledged as one of the best sports for obtaining and sustaining physical fitness in a fun way.• Judo teaches and practices one to one physical sport in a controlled and managed way with a focus on fair play and respect.• Judo is a sport where people can practice as individuals as opposed to being in a team where only the best players are included.• Judo has a structured grading system which provides the students with targets to aim for which is good for their development and personal to them.• Judo gives provides the opportunity to be the best you can in a safe environment.We are very strict in our teaching of etiquette, courtesy, respect for yourself and for others and general good behaviour.Our club is predominately a young persons development club (although we do differentiate sessions to accommodate all abilities levels), which means that through our Junior Coaches development scheme occasional sessions are taught by junior coaches under the guidance and supervision of a qualified and insured (minimum) UKCC level 2 or equivalent coach and with prior notification to parents and students alike. These sessions are only conducted under the strictest health and safety guidance.We look forward to seeing you soon!writeFlash({""quality"":""high"",""src"":""http://www.northbrookjudo.co.uk/js/plugins/imagemanager/files/northbrook/flash/jp4.swf"",""width"":""485"",""height"":""292""});

Our director is Margaret Moss MA (Cantab) UCTD (Manchester) DipION C Biol MRSB MBANT, CNHC Registered Nutritional Therapy Practitioner and Chartered Biologist.The Nutrition and Allergy Clinic is a busy clinic, whose motto is science and compassion. The first step is to fill in a questionnaire, about diet, lifestyle and signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies. The nutritional therapist will then discuss this with you, and build up a picture of your body chemistry replica watches. She will use this to devise a suitable diet for you, offer you recipes, advise on possible lifestyle changes if necessary, and discuss with you what nutritional supplements may be relevant. She may suggest laboratory tests.Our bodies have individual needs for vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. They react differently to foods and chemicals. Nutritional therapy is designed to optimise a person’s health, after considering individual differences.Cisco 642-883 SPROUTE, /

As the UK’s first
Interim Management firm, we believe in the power of people in business and our ability to get you resultsSee Our Work   Who We Are“Melissa's support, interest and intelligent involvement made what might have been quite a challenging process into an exciting and enjoyable one - thank you!” – Sands“We got great service… So good that we returned for a third role a few months later. I felt very well supported from start to finish, and the results are great.” - Beat“Russam GMS provided a perfectly appropriate and highly appreciated service. The outcome was not just the right candidate, but also confidence that the process had been both comprehensive and fair.” – NAM""We chose Russam GMS for our interim resourcing roles for a few simple reasons:  They understand our business and they deliver on our business requirements.  They deliver the right people, with the right skills, for the right project.  We have now taken on two senior level interim project managers that have helped us to deliver on our business plan.""
Lene Nielsen, Vice President - Human Resources, Rothschild Bank AG“Russam GMS really understand our business and have formed a strong relationship that goes way beyond recruitment. The principals have deep industry knowledge and the company hosts thought provoking networking events and invite us even when we are not working with them. They are very credible people who are great to work with.”
Marcus Lee, Head of HR, Santander“The Interims we hired from Russam were effective from day one. This was essential as we had specific
projects that were critical to our business and we did not have the right skills in-house to
accomplish them.  We learnt a great deal from our interim managers. The HR Interim reviewed our HR
processes and made some excellent recommendations for improvement.”
Dr Jimmy Chan, Director at Orbis“Russam provides the most comprehensive, human and friendly service in the industry. Its consultants go the extra mile to make sure clients and candidates are well looked after.”

Based in Cornwall, Sandokai has a long history in the South West of the UK, tracing it's roots to the first ever Karate club in Cornwall which opened up in the 1960's.Sandokai's Chief Instructor, Robin Whale, started training in 1969 with the highest graded  karateka in Cornwall - a green belt in Wado Ryu!Sandokai roughly translates as ""School of Three Ways"", the three ways or ""paths"" being Kihon (training drills), Kata (forms or patterns) and Kumite (fighting).Though not a large Karate Association by any means, Sandokai strives to ensure that it teaches and promotes top quality martial arts.We have developed a syllabus based on traditional Japanese karate concepts, mixing both the ""modern"" karate format (as introduced by Funakoshi Gichin in the early 1920s) with much of the original martial forms which predate the ""sanitization"" and ""popularisation"" of karate over 100 years ago.Combined with our karate we try to utilise modern sports' training knowledge and methodologies from a variety of sources such as Sport Science, Psychology, Biomechanics and Plyometrics.Sandokai is proud to maintain very high standards. If all you want to do is get a black belt then Sandokai is not for you. We do not ""hand out"" belts. We firmly believe that if one of our black belts walks into any karate club in Great Britain (s)he will be as good as, if not better than, a comparable black belt in that club.There is an old Chinese saying, ""the longest journey starts with but a single step"". Karate is a lifelong journey, and we intend to be here with you from that first step to your last.

                MatthewsIf you are looking for an enjoyable walk with 
                  a spooky secret to send a shiver up your spine, then these are 
                  the books for you. Located across English counties are walks 
                  ranging from a gentle stroll of less than a mile up to bracing 
                  routes that cover 12 miles or more. Each of the walks in this 
                  book takes the reader past the haunt of more than one ghostly 
                  visitor - be it a phantom monk, spectral soldier or a surprisingly 
                  modern lady in a tweed suitDebra 
                        Munn1 85770 318 9£8.99Many books about Sussex ghosts have been written 
                  over the years, but as far as we know, this is the first to 
                  focus solely upon haunted historic properties that the public 
                  may visit.Sussex, has more than its share of haunted historic 
                  properties where people have lived and died. Debra Munn has 
                  searched pout tales of the supernatural at forty of these places 
                  open to the public - manors, palaces, abbeys, castles, fortresses 
                  and even windmills - where live visitors are just as welcome 
                  as ghosts.HAUNTED INNS OF KENTRoger

                supernatural happenings, from London's borders to Deal, from Thanet 
                to wild Walland Marsh and from the windswept Weald to sea-soaked 
                Sheppey. He describes spectral smugglers, nefarious nuns, miserable 
                monks, spirited sailors, murdered maids and many more. Ghosts 
                of every persuasion inhabit Kent's hostelries, there's even a 
                tram driver and a curious canine. So, greetings from the terrifying 
                to the titillating inept spirits of over fifty watering holes.UNKNOWN GHOSTS OF THE SOUTH EASTJust who is the small boy seen 
                  at Folkestone's Martello Tower and who walks the stairs of a 
                  Battle hotel? In this collection of unidentified ghosts, strange 
                  sightings and unexplained events, the writer Andrew Green, with 
                  60 years experience in paranormal investigation has brought 
                  together reports from Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Will anyone uncover

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism. 

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass. 

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself. 

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. 

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.

""The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate... Returning violence for violence multiples violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars.

My Passion in Acting
I love acting since I was in high school. I was part of a group of actors in my school and since I joined the team when I was still a junior in high school we greatly excelled throughout my high school studies. We represented our school at various levels in the theatre festivals and it was all a fulfilling life to me. After high school, I decided to join college and pursue a degree in creative and performing arts. It was while that I was in college that I had the greatest success in the field. By this time, we had formed a local group of actors and we would perform in major theaters around town on weekend and during special occasions.
I became so passionate in acting and drama-related stuff and made my name known. There was even a time when I was considering being a stand-up comedian but decided against the idea. I was popular among college students and also made my name with various acting groups within town. I then thought of being involved in a video based on various ways to burn fat such as fun exercises or even certain health foods, which would be a fabulous idea as there is always a bunch of people that would watch.
There were times that they could seek my services in specific roles, though I declined most of the offers because I wanted to concentrate on my studies. I only practice in the evening and weekends at school hence I couldn’t travel far from school from.
Two years ago, just while I was in my final years in college, I was fortunate enough to attend an audition for a drama TV show that was to be aired locally. I qualified for the auditions and decided that it was time that I went to the capital city and where the practicing and choreographing would be taking place. I had now to become a distance learner as I concentrated on my career. I had a dream of making it big in the film industry and was determined to see this dream come true.
How Cancer Almost Killed my Dreams
However, that didn’t come to pass. Barely a week after I bid my family goodbye and went to settle in the city, I got a call from my dad. He had some very disturbing news. My mum had been diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer. The news really shocked me and I didn’t know what to do. I was the oldest and my only sister was still in high school. Dada had his own share of problems since he too was diagnosed of lung cancer a year. He was still undergoing treatments and during this time it was my mother who was taking care of him. Now that she too had it, I knew that things would be tough.
After contemplating over the whole issue, I knew that my presence was needed to help and support them as they battled the monstrous diseases. That meant that I had no option but to relinquish my role in the TV show and go home to be with them. I did exactly that.
Since the cancer had spread much, the best solution for her was to undergo a mastectomy. My mum underwent a mastectomy three months after the diagnosis and then was subjected to systematic therapy (a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy and hormonal therapy) and radiation for the next 8 months. During that period, my dad succumbed to lung cancer and died.
Fortunately, my mum recovered after the radiation and survived cancer. I have still been staying with her even after graduating from college though I now considering going back to my dream career of acting. Hope I will land on a good role.Wow…. You really do look like her.

We represented our school at various levels in the theatre festivals and it was all a fulfilling life to me. After high school, I decided to join college and pursue a degree in creative and performing arts. It was while that I was in college that I had the greatest success in the field. By this time, we had formed a local group of actors and we would perform in major theaters around town on weekend and during special occasions.
I became so passionate in acting and drama-related stuff and made my name known. There was even a time when I was considering being a stand-up comedian but decided against the idea. I was popular among college students and also made my name with various acting groups within town. I then thought of being involved in a video based on various ways to burn fat such as fun exercises or even certain health foods, which would be a fabulous idea as there is always a bunch of people that would watch.
There were times that they could seek my services in specific roles, though I declined most of the offers because I wanted to concentrate on my studies. I only practice in the evening and weekends at school hence I couldn’t travel far from school from.
Two years ago, just while I was in my final years in college, I was fortunate enough to attend an audition for a drama TV show that was to be aired locally. I qualified for the auditions and decided that it was time that I went to the capital city and where the practicing and choreographing would be taking place. I had now to become a distance learner as I concentrated on my career. I had a dream of making it big in the film industry and was determined to see this dream come true.
How Cancer Almost Killed my Dreams
However, that didn’t come to pass. Barely a week after I bid my family goodbye and went to settle in the city, I got a call from my dad. He had some very disturbing news. My mum had been diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer. The news really shocked me and I didn’t know what to do. I was the oldest and my only sister was still in high school. Dada had his own share of problems since he too was diagnosed of lung cancer a year. He was still undergoing treatments and during this time it was my mother who was taking care of him. Now that she too had it, I knew that things would be tough.
After contemplating over the whole issue, I knew that my presence was needed to help and support them as they battled the monstrous diseases. That meant that I had no option but to relinquish my role in the TV show and go home to be with them. I did exactly that.
Since the cancer had spread much, the best solution for her was to undergo a mastectomy. My mum underwent a mastectomy three months after the diagnosis and then was subjected to systematic therapy (a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy and hormonal therapy) and radiation for the next 8 months. During that period, my dad succumbed to lung cancer and died.
Fortunately, my mum recovered after the radiation and survived cancer. I have still been staying with her even after graduating from college though I now considering going back to my dream career of acting. Hope I will land on a good role.I would fit in better, not to burst your bubble or anything…

Traveling abroad can be exciting and fun but getting stranded in a location where you do not speak the language is no fun at all. European breakdown cover can help. Whether you are traveling for pleasure or for business purposes, the right breakdown policy can save your trip from becoming interrupted or completely spoiled.Get the Right PolicyNot all breakdown policies are the same, so it is important to get the right one. It needs to offer assistance in the countries that are on your list of places to go. It should cover the car that you are driving, which means it must cover a vehicle of the age and type you are driving. It must also cover the type of trip you are taking, whether it is for pleasure or for work. Purchasing the wrong policy will only lead to disappointment. The right policy will be like having a good friend you can call when trouble strikes.Coverage for Multiple Countries and SituationsLet’s suppose for just a minute that you want to go on a motor tour of Europe. Most of it is just for fun, but you also have a business conference in Paris that you must attend, and you might be visiting some clients along the way. You will take in a concert in Sweden, visit the Louvre in Paris, look at the remains of the Wall in Berlin, explore some Basque artwork and knitting, then view running with the bulls in Spain. This is going to involve many miles of driving, most of it through unfamiliar terrain. You will want a policy that will have contacts in each country, that will cover not only pleasure driving but also business travel, and that will have a hotline in your native language. That’s a pretty tall order, but many insurance companies with breakdown policies can do just that.Age of Your VehicleBreakdown policies have vehicle age limits for good reason. The older your vehicle, the more likely it is to develop mechanical problems and the harder it is going to be to obtain parts. If you are planning a motor tour, it is a very good idea to have a vehicle that is less than ten years old and that is in excellent repair before you start. The exception might be if you were taking part in a classic car race or similar event, in which case you would want an entirely different sort of insurance. Signing up for some types of breakdown insurance needs to occur within the first two years of a vehicle’s life, and then be kept up during subsequent years. Fortunately, the roadside assistance type is usually available for most vehicles under 15 years in age and when in good repair at establishing the policy.Limited Call OutsIf you are vacationing in Europe, you are unlikely to exceed the limit for the number of times you can call on your breakdown cover for assistance. However, if you have a regular sales or meeting circuit, you might want to consider the number of times per year that your policy will cover. Most insurance companies with breakdown policies prefer customers to keep their vehicle in good repair and that they will take steps to avoid situations such as running down the battery or leaving keys inside the vehicle. After a specified number of responses, you might find yourself relying solely on local response agencies. You can avoid this sort of scenario by taking good care of your vehicle and maintaining it in the best possible working order, something you will want to do anyway. Even with the best breakdown policy in the world, you don’t want to spend your vacation or work time dealing with auto repairs.Payday loans are becoming the first option of many individuals. There are lots of reasons available behind it. The biggest reason is related to the way of applying for a loan and some other factors. There are lots of things related to the payday loan. The applicants should have proper knowledge regarding these things. In the upcoming points, you can get the explanation of some of these.Unsecured loanMost of the financial institutions are providing loan facility by taking some risk covering measures. Mainly these measures are beneficial in the recovery of loan. Sometimes, the institutions are asking for submitting any type of collateral asset. These types of loans are considered as the mortgage loans.In case the borrower is not able to pay the money back then the institution gets the ownership of that collateral. These loans are also known as the secured loans. In the case of payday loans, these types of security measures are not taken by the financial institutions.According to the fund providers, the payday loan applicants can make repayment without any kind of issue. For it, they are checking the employment history or records of the applicant only. Due to these factors, anyone can easily avail the facility of payday loan without any type of collateral or mortgage.Loan at low costIf we talk about the secured and some other types of loans, then the individuals need to pay lots of money. Mainly this particular amount of money is paying on the basis of –There are numerous other things available those responsible for increasing the cost of a loan. If we think about the payday loans, then these types of expenses are reduced. The borrowers are required to pay an amount of money which includes all types of charges. All these things are helpful in reducing the cost of a loan and availing several benefits. You should consider the way of payday loans and try to save the money.Best for emergenciesIn the emergencies, some individuals need to take help of money. Due to the financial issues, they are not able to get the required amount of funds easily. As a result, they are trying to find the best source which can help them in gathering the required amount of money with ease.For all these things, they need to focus on lots of things. In case you want to take help from any type of quick option the way of cobrapaydayloans.co.uk is perfect. By accessing the services of a payday loan, the applicant can receive money in a short time period. As a result, they do not need to wait, and they can easily face the emergency.How to choose the best loan provider?When you are thinking of availing the loan services at that time, you can get lots of options. All these options are becoming a reason for confusion among borrowers. As a result, the interested borrowers are not able to choose the final one for getting a loan. In case you are facing a similar condition then consider the following points.Rate of interest/chargesThe interested loan applicants are required to focus on the interest rates of the financial institutions. Rate of charging interest of all institutions is not similar. The applicants should try to find the institution which provides a higher amount of loan easily at a lower rate of interest.With it, they should be focused on the additional charges. The additional charges of a financial institution are different from others. You should properly check out these two things before finalizing the decision and applying for the loan.Fund provider should be registeredThe individuals those want funds for facing the financial issues they need to choose the best institution. For it, first of all, they are required to check out the registration. Considering the registered institution is a good decision taken by the individuals. Now the question appears how to make sure that the fund provider is registered or not.For such a task, the individuals should consider the way of the license number. They should check out the license or any kind of evidence by which they can get surety regarding its registration.Terms and conditionsAll individuals should check out the terms and condition of all funds providers. Some institutions have different rules and regulations. By checking these things, you can make sure that the company is providing services in a suitable way or not. In case the terms & conditions of the institution are so rigid and appearing as issues then do not consider it.Data Monitor (a research and business information group) stated that 9 million UK citizens are refused credit each year. Those who don’t qualify for mainstream credit may find that a pawnshop loan can help them out of a tight spot.When a consumer has an adverse credit history and needs to borrow money fast, securing no credit check finance from a pawnshop or payday lender could provide the answer. However, it should be considered to be a short-term source of borrowing only.Pawn Shop Loans – Borrow Money Fast with No Credit Check FinanceA loan from a pawnbroker is an increasingly popular way of borrowing money without undergoing credit scoring. It is a poor credit history loan that is granted on the basis of collateral. Jewelry, electrical goods, collectibles, life/endowment policy, shares, vehicle and gold loans are offered on more favourable terms because the lender is able to sell the item to recover their money.Growth of Pawn Shop Loans – Gold, Vehicle, Electrical Equipment and Jewelry LoansA&B and H&T pawnbrokers both reported an increase in pre-tax profits of over 30%. According to Brewin & Dolphin (investment analysts) “We calculate the specialist market is capable of doubling in size as traditional sources of consumer credit are withdrawn and the gold price remains high.” The high street presence of pawnbroker shops is expected to increase over the next few years.How to Get a Poor Credit History Loan from a PawnbrokerNo Credit Check Finance – Borrow Money Fast, But How Much?The majority of jewelry and gold loans are for relatively small amounts. However, it is possible to get no credit check finance for well over £10,000. The rate of interest reduces on a sliding scale as the amount of money borrowed gets higher. The monthly interest rate is generally in the 3% to 6% range. It is possible to borrow money for any purpose.Successfully Applying for a Pawnbroker LoanA pawn shop loan is an ideal, affordable source of no credit check finance based on the provision of collateral. It is possible to borrow money fast for an emergency expense, such as paying the rent or an unexpected bill. It is important that a loan from a pawnbroker is redeemed within the specified timeframe or the item will be sold to recover the principal and any interest that has accrued.You may decide to apply for a doorstep collections loan if you’ve got a poor credit history and have been refused credit elsewhere. The reason that doorstep lenders have become so popular is because they don’t credit score applicants, lend money to unemployed people on benefits and offer convenient repayment terms.You’re able to borrow money on a completely unsecured basis so you don’t stand to lose any collateral. Doorstep cash loans with defaults are strictly regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and shouldn’t be confused with borrowing money from an unethical and unregulated loan shark.How Doorstep Collection Loans for People with Defaults WorkAll that you need to do is submit a straight-forward online application and you’ll be given a lending decision in principle within a few minutes. Alternatively, if you prefer the human touch, you can apply for a doorstep cash loan through your local agent. You can normally book an appointment to see someone within 3 working days.Completely new customers can easily borrow £500 today. The maximum repayment term varies between lenders, but it’s possible to repay the debt over a period of up to 52 weeks. It doesn’t matter if you are out of work or have bad credit, you just need to prove that you can afford to make the repayments.Doorstep Collection Loans with Defaults for Low Income FamiliesThe only way to ensure that the repayments are affordable to you is by not over-borrowing. This is particularly important when you’re trying to get by on state benefits or a low income. Your advisor helps establish whether a fast cash advance loan is feasible or not as it’s not in their interests to see you struggle.Once you’ve received the cash, the repayments will be collected each week by your local agent. This is particularly useful if you have no bank account to set up a standing order. A £300 doorstep collection loan over 52 weeks from Provident Personal Credit will cost you just £10.50 per week.Bad Credit Doorstep Loan Lenders & the Consequences of DefaultIf you fall into financial difficulties, always keep doorstep loan companies informed so that you can reach an amicable solution. Although your quick cash advance is unsecured, non-payment will mean that interest and charges will continue to accrue. Don’t just hope that the problem will go away because it won’t.Unpaid doorstep collection loans will be passed to a collection agency and they will pursue you for the balance. On the plus side, if you pay punctually and establish a good working relationship with a doorstep lender, you’ll be eligible to borrow more and spread the repayments over a longer timeframe.Ever wonder why college students are swarmed with credit card offers? It’s because credit card companies think students are suckers. Many students make bad choices with credit cards, and credit card companies benefit.Many student credit cards come with very high interest rates. Interest refers to the money you have to pay if you buy something and pay it off in installments instead of all at once. When you pay something off in installments, you pay an extra fee every month, based on how much you owe and the interest rate. (Almost all loans are paid back with interest payments, including mortgages, car purchases, and student loans.) If you have a low interest rate, the extra money you pay every month won’t be too bad. If you have a high interest rate, you’ll be paying lots of extra money every month, and it may become very difficult to pay off your credit card debt!Credit card companies are counting on students to spend beyond their means with their credit card. They make a fortune on interest payments from college students.So, does that mean you shouldn’t get a credit card? No. Actually, most college students would benefit from having a credit card, as long as they use it wisely. If you pay your credit card bills on time every month, you will build a good credit score, which you will need later to make major purchases like houses and cars. In addition, having a credit card for financial emergencies is important. And without a credit card, it becomes difficult to purchase things online.So, how does one use a credit card responsibly? Here are some credit card do’s and don’ts.CREDIT CARD DO’S AND DON’TS" 93871.0 0.0 "Which way to go - You choose"

Biomedical research (or experimental medicine), in general simply known as medical research, is the basic research, applied research, or translational research conducted to aid the body of knowledge in the field of medicine. Medical research can be divided into two general categories: the evaluation of new treatments for both safety and efficacy in what are termed clinical trials, and all other research that contributes to the development of new treatments. The latter is termed preclinical research if its goal is specifically to elaborate knowledge for the development of new therapeutic strategies. A new paradigm to biomedical research is being termed translational research, which focuses on iterative feedback loops between the basic and clinical research domains to accelerate knowledge translation from the bedside to the bench, and back again.The increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research. Among the major benefits have been vaccines for measles and polio, insulin treatment for diabetes, classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies, medication for high blood pressure, improved treatments for AIDS, statins and other treatments for atherosclerosis, new surgical techniques such as microsurgery, and increasingly successful treatments for cancer. New, beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the human genome project. Many challenges remain, however, including the appearance of antibiotic resistance and the obesity epidemic.Most of the research in the field is pursued by biomedical scientists in cooperation with molecular biologists.Preclinical research is research in basic science, which precedes the clinical trials, and is almost purely based on theory and animal experiments.New treatments come about as a result of other, earlier discoveries — often unconnected to each other, and in various fields. Sometimes the research is done for non-medical purposes, and only by accident contributes to the field of medicine (for example, the discovery of penicillin). Clinicians use these discoveries to create a treatment regimen, which is then tested in clinical trials.A clinical trial is a comparison test of a medication or other medical treatment, versus a placebo, other medications and devices, or the standard medical treatment for a patient's condition. Clinical trials vary greatly in size: from a single researcher in one hospital or clinic to an international multicenter trial with several hundred participating researchers on several continents. The number of patients tested can range from as few as a dozen to several thousands.Research funding in many countries comes from research bodies which distribute money for equipment and salaries. In the UK, funding bodies such as the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust derive their assets from UK tax payers, and distribute this to institutions in a competitive manner.In the United States, the most recent data from 2003 suggest that about 94 billion dollars were provided for biomedical research in the United States. The National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies collectively contribute 26.4 billion dollars and 27.0 billion dollars, respectively, which constitute 28% and 29% of the total, respectively. Other significant contributors include biotechnology companies (17.9 billion dollars, 19% of total), medical device companies (9.2 billion dollars, 10% of total), other federal sources, and state and local governments. Foundations and charities, led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, contributed about 3% of the funding.The enactment of orphan drug legislation in some countries has increased funding available to develop drugs meant to treat rare conditions, resulting in breakthroughs that previously were uneconomical to pursue.Medical research is highly regulated. National regulatory authorities oversee and monitor medical research, such as for the development of new drugs. In the USA the Food and Drug Administration oversees new drug development, in Europe the European Medicines Agency (see also EudraLex), and in Japan the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan). The World Medical Association develops the ethical standards for the medical profession, involved in medical research. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) works on the creation of rules and guidelines for the development of new medication, such as the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). All ideas of regulation are based on a country's etchics standards code. This is why treatment of a particular disease in one country may not be allowed, but is in another.In 2001, the editors of 12 major journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication. They strengthened editorial restrictions to counter the effect. The editorial noted that contract research organizations had, by 2000, received 60% of the grants from pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. Researchers may be restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results." 95695.0 0.0 "Seriously  Ill for Medical Research"

Since 1896An experience above everything else.Since 1896 visitors have been travelling to Llanberis, to experience the unique rail journey to the Summit of the highest mountain in Wales and England. A true mountain and place of legend, come with us and see exactly why Snowdon Mountain Railway has been described as one of the most unique and wonderful railway journeys in the world. With stunning scenery and awe-inspiring views it’s all part of a great day out for you and your family in North Wales.The Snowdon Mountain Railway has been on my bucket list for years and at last the dream was realised. We opted for a steam trip and were not disappointed. On the contrary we had a wonderful journey to the Summit of Snowdon and back and were fortunate to have decent weather. Having done it once I would quite happily repeat the experience.Excellent facilities and friendly staff.This was amazingly scenic/ beautiful/ mesmerising etc etc. The changing scenery as you ascend/ descend is fantastic! Its been on my bucket list and now ive done it! The mist was down at the summit but made it atmospheric. Added to the experience. Was worth every penny.This was a fantastic journey with breathtaking views and the most stunning scenery, wild romantic, rugged and totally special. This trip is worth every pound.You need to plan and book ahead for this, especially to get the steam engine ride, which I highly recommend. They day we went, all train rides were sold out days in advance. Both the Diesel and steam engines are the same trip, with spectacular views during the ride and at the top, but there's something really special about steam engines (besides being pretty rare, steam engines are noisy and romantic and when working hard going up the hill they really do say ""I think I can I think I can...""). This was one of the high-points of our UK travels.We spent the day catching the steam train to the top of Mount Snowdon and walking to the summit. It was everything we hoped for and more. The train left on time and we met some wonderful fellow travellers on the one hour trip to the top. We were so lucky to have stunning weather and be able to enjoy the sensational scenery along the way. Lots of photos were taken at the top and I was so impressed watching those hiking up the mountain - we would have done that if not for my husband's limited lung capacity. If you get a chance to do this.....do it! It's amazing.If in North Wales a visit here is a must. Travelling up Snowdon in a 'Victorian' type carriage gives you views to be marvelled at. Journey is slow- 1 hour up and 1 hour back- with a half hour stop at the summit over 3,500 feet up. A photographer's heaven. Not to be missed.Went on the mountain railway by the steam train. What an experience. The views were out of this world. Not to be missed if you go to Snowdonia. The staff member who rode on the train with us was very informative and friendly which made the journey great. There is parking right by the station if you are a blue badge holder.+44 (0) 1286 870 223

	SokariBlind Love and Grace was part of the Primavera exhibition at the October Gallery in 2016.The reinterpretation of a section of Botticelli’s painting. Created with oil barrels, cut in half then and opening up revealing Grace. A figure dressed in lace and a red shawl, looking like a West African lady but with the style of a renaissance figure.The barrels are broken into branches that fan out to create an environment a  forest and light behind the figure of Grace. She holds up her hand as if blessing or giving benediction to the viewer. Banana trees balance the stage either side of her and a fat cherub pointing his arrow in readiness to pierce someone’s heart flies above. Everything is made of steel but they all seem light.Categories: Featured and Works for sale17.04.2017

	SokariThis sculpture was created for an exhibition ‘Between the Worlds’ Schloss Roskow Germany in response to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Creating or acknowledging a new law is like creating new people. Our behavior and aspirations should change because of these new laws. A new law supporting children all over the world is a good start to a better future.At the moment I am very inspired by ancient art from Italy Botticelli, Michael Angelo and so on, looking at iconic images from the Sistine chapel I was attracted to the painting of God creating Adam, I love the hand gesture of this composition as so many people recognize it. Interpreting this in steel, I have decided to concentrate on god and his cloak of cherubs and people. Was Michael Angelo trying to express how complex God is? Anyway my rendition is god with children in his cloak. His hand is out stretched. Once installed, I hope viewers will adopt Adam’s iconic pose of almost touching God.My sculptured god and his children are created from recycled oil barrels and olive oil cans, oil is wealth, anointed in oil, are these children good or bad? Is oil bad? It was created by God (if you believe in him).My hope is to create a layered work that is contemporary but has a core of Western art history.Categories: Featured and Works for sale17.04.2017

	SokariThis piece was inspired by a drawing by William Blake with the same title, I have Africanized the figures; dressing them in cloth that could come from different parts of the world, echoing; Asia a paisley motived fabric, then a Mondrian pattern that looks like sleek building blocks to represent Europe and a woven cloth with an Igbo pattern for Africa. The women have gele head ties (this fabric is produced in Switzerland). The three graces represent women in the world resting on their laurels as humankind is holding a wreath which ends with a petrol nozzles; their back drop is mountains and they stand gracefully on a cushion of lush grass and flowers.  I really enjoyed working with Blake’s sketch making sure the figures stood and touched as they do in his drawing. I think the work is international and conscious of our humanity and the coercion in working with each other and not caring for the environment. Business as usual?Categories: Featured and Works for sale17.04.2017

	SokariBotticelli painted ‘Primavera’ and one of the women in the painting is Flora Primavera is a painting about Spring, the entire piece (Allegory of the Spring) to which Vasari gave the name Primavera – some 70 years after Botticelli finished it.Most people recognize the word ‘Primavera’ as something to do with spring, without knowing all the facts. I have approached this work intuitively. The idea of spring, flowers, so bright and colorful that they look like sweets, mixed with new toy cars, that my nieces children play with. Materialism and a clash of the past and the present. My sculpture carries flowers and toy cars that she seems to be collecting or giving away.When I look at Botticelli’s painting the beautiful people their fine clothes wealth and fantasy is so compelling. Primavera (the sculpture) is a visual image with a twist.Categories: Featured and Works for sale16.03.2014

	SokariI am very conscious that my home in Niger Delta is in a very bad place at the moment because of pollution and lack of employment. I work hard, thinking of positive things that could happen – I feel that the negatives are so big that if we talk about them all the time we will have nothing to look forward to. Funnily enough , this brings out humour in the work I make.William Blake has a drawing of a figure that looks as if it is creating the world; Urizen- I like this drawing . I love poses done with hands and bodies by rap stars and foot ballers. Far from Blake but not so far. Anyway my’ god’ is a woman, she is creating growth from a split oil barrel, Her lower half is covered by smurf pattern. I did not want to go down the path of ‘ African’ material.There was an article in the times newspaper of a roman sculpture that had been found off the coast of Gaza, a fisher man found it caught in his net and got his friends to use their boats to drag it to the beach. When they finally got it onto dry land, some cultural police came along and said the sculpture was against Islam and then some other police came along and said it should not be seen by anyone because it was an abomination. There was a little photograph of this sculpture and it was resting on a mattress which had a pattern of the Smurfs.Very often when you see tragedy or something very serious there is a commercial light thing in the same picture. People in temporary housing with a Mickey mouse poster keeping their shelter intact. A fierce Taliban fighter hiding his identity with a picture of Britney hanging off a wall…..Categories: Works for sale16.03.2014

	SokariI was not sure what sort of title to give this piece ‘ All that glitters …pretending.’ I wanted to continue making works like ‘Jesus loves me’ figures in Hip-hop and R&B poses. I came across a photograph of an east London Asian boy with his arms folded and his legs in a splits position in a church door way and I thought it was so striking. Full of bravado and also history in that it could be a pose from some traditional religion but the person performing it was in jeans with his T-shirt off, twisted into his pocket.Anyway I love the ‘balls’ of successful Nigerians and the theme of showing off seemed like a good idea for this work to follow. The glittering woman is not only glittering she is showing off being invincible, astride sliced oil barrels. Cool. And a little funny. Could this be a description of Nigeria at this time? I am trying to look at the positives in life.Categories: Works for sale16.03.2013

	SokariThis sculpture features Victorian influenced clothing in Namibia, the hands are saluting or surrendering to the viewer is so intriguing. Pattern making and posing is an important element of this work, because the Herero people were forced into wearing this form of clothing. But they made it their own by adding head wear that is fashioned into the form of cow horns, something that they admire. ‘Looking for grace’ faces the viewer with the history and culture of Namibian people. The artist has used this pose in the search for the sublime.Categories: Commisioned work03.08.2012

	Sokari‘All the World is now Richer’ is a sculpture to commemorate the abolition of slavery. The sculpture hopes to show that the people of slave heritage are brave and have dignity and strength.The vertical component consists of a line of life- sized figures representing successive stages of the slavery saga. Thus the line starts with a figure clad in indigenous robes. Then come two figures representing trans-Atlantic slave labour: a plantation worker with a machete and a domestic serving woman. These are followed by three figures representing the post- liberation era: a Sierra Leonean woman in nineteenth –century Creole dress, a man in a twentieth century executive suit and finally another relaxing in casual trousers and a tee-shirt.The literal component consists of phrases referring to the stage in the saga represented by its corresponding figure.A chance to show these figures in the Great Hall at the Houses of Parliament, during President Obama’s visit, would show the role the Houses of Parliament have played through world history.This sculpture has been exhibited in the House of Commons, Bristol Cathedral, Norfolk Cathedral, and St Paul’s Cathedral. It toured from 2010-2014.Here is a film featuring this project:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP670ylRhzgCategories: Works for sale03.08.2012

	SokariHow do you show that the people of slave heritage are brave and have dignity and strength? How do you show the social and economic legacy that has benefited the world from their suffering? My piece is marked by mutually complementary vertical and horizontal components. The vertical component consists of a line of life- sized figures representing successive stages of the slavery saga. Thus the line starts with a figure clad in indigenous robes. Then come two figures representing trans-Atlantic slave labour: a plantation worker with a machete and a domestic serving woman. These are followed by three figures representing the post- liberation era: a Sierra Leonean woman in nineteenth –century Creole dress, a man in a twentieth century executive suit and finally another relaxing in casual trousers and a tee-shirt. The horizontal component consists of a series of sculpted “shadows” thrown out to the right from the successive figures. Each “shadow” is a strip containing a phrase referring to the stage in the saga represented by its corresponding figure. “From our rich ancestral life” “We were sold, bought and used” “But we were brave” “We were strong” “We survived” “All the world is now richer” The piece is arranged, on the one hand so that the viewers can walk around its perimeter and grasp the saga as a whole ,on the other so that in threading their way back and forth between the figures- and “ shadows” , they can take in its stages more slowly ,closely and reflectively. Materials Materials and fixings have been chosen for their long life robustness and high quality. The figures will be cast in bronze. The words will be cast in cast-iron and fixed to the Portland stone paving. The piece will be discreetly lit and set into a landscape garden.Categories: Proposals22.10.2012

At Somnus it happens by design. Something that we improve and perfect through constant testing and innovation. It’s the difference made by sensa intelligent pocket springs and the home-grown natural fillings, as well as the quality craftsmanship that makes every one of our luxury beds unique. At Somnus, beds are not the end result, they are just the beginning.Every Somnus mattress is British by design; from the locally sourced natural upholstery fillings we use inside each pocket sprung mattress, to the British craftsmen that assemble them. It is a traditional way of creating quality beds that we’ve kept alive for five generations – a tradition that always puts luxury and comfort first.At Somnus, our craftsmen aren’t just bed experts, they are sleep specialists who use their traditional craftsmanship skills to create a superior level of comfort in every Somnus bed.Introducing Sensa Intelligent Pocket springs, the latest piece of innovation at the heart of our beds. This innovative technology ensures you always maintain the perfect sleeping posture.When William Rhodes founded Somnus back in 1840, he wanted to make a very different kind of bed. Our dedication to this ideal has led to countless spring innovations over the last 178 years.On our own farm in North Yorkshire, we tend a very special flock of sheep and alpacas that are behind the Yorkshire Dales Eco Wool and alpaca fleece that you’ll find inside our Somnus beds.Technological innovation is paramount to us at Somnus. It led to our invention of the double-tiered spring system back in 1924, a world first, and is what has driven us to the latest piece of innovation at the heart of our luxury beds: the Sensa Intelligent pocket spring system.This innovative technology used in our pocket spring mattresses helps distribute the sleeper’s weight across a higher number of independent springs, ensuring you always maintain the perfect sleeping posture. The pocket springs help support your body more evenly and reduce pressure points, providing a more restful sleep.Our latest pocket spring innovation builds on our desire to develop ever more sustainable and natural sleeping environments. NatureCoil is a weldable, 100% plant based pocket for our springs. It is a green alternative to other pockets and just one of many eco-innovations to come.Once upon a time, Britain was the centre of the world when it came to weaving. We are striving to revive this special tradition by investing in state of the art looms at our Yorkshire based manufacturing facility. Our intention being that we can weave the finest quality mattress fabric for our beds. Not only are we moving the art of bed making forward, we’re bringing back things that matter.Every Somnus mattress is British through and through; from the locally sourced materials we use inside them, to the British craftsmen and women that assemble them.

Village ProfileSouth Brent is a large village on the southern edge of Dartmoor. The Parish is the second largest (after Cornwood) in South Hams at 3742 ha, and 6th largest (after Ivybridge, Totnes, Kingsbridge, Dartmouth and Bickleigh) with a population of 3043 in 2012.The village was originally a woollen and market centre with 2 annual fairs and a station. Now the village centre is within Dartmoor National Park, and it is a thriving community with shops, businesses, school, village hall and community centre.The Parish Council consists of 12 elected councillors - 9 from the Village Ward, and 3 from Brent Moor Ward. The present Council were elected/co-opted in May 2015, and will serve for 4 years until 2019. A list of the Councillors may be found here.Parish Council meetings normally take place in the Side Hall at the Village Hall, on the 4th Monday of each month starting at 7:30pm. In August the meeting takes place at The Old SChool Community Centre.  All members of the public are invited to attend meetings, and will have the opportunity to speak at a public forum at the start of each meeting.Dartmoor National Park are publishing a draft new Local Plan for Dartmoor, and consulting on it between 3rd December 2018 and 4th February 2019.The Local Plan is an important document which sets out what type of development is and isn’t acceptable in the National Park.It is what Dartmoor National Park use to decide planning applications, and sets out where future development may take place.To see a copy of the poster with details of the venues for the drop in events - Download HereFurther to the earlier information about the developments following the closure of the South Brent Post Office, although some finer details are to be confirmed, a temporary solution of an Outreach Post Office Service run by the Strete Postmistress is being put in place.The new arrangements for Post Office Services in the Old School Community Centre will commence from Wednesday 17th January 2018 on:Huge thanks are owed to the Trustees of the Old School Community Centre and Centre Manager and Glyn Richards in particular for the work he has done in facilitating this.This arrangement can continue while longer term arrangements are explored. The best option remains for an existing South Brent retailer to offer to host the service and several local retailers have been approached. If you know of a retailer who might be interested in discussing hosting Post Office services in the village, they can be put in touch with the relevant Post Office manager via the Parish Clerk (This email address is being protected from spambots.

The Lothian Cycle CampaignWelcome to the online home of Spokes, the Lothian Cycle Campaign… Continue reading Welcome To SpokesAfter a ‘hiatus 2018‘ for active travel in Edinburgh, 2019 looks set to be either the most momentous – or the most disappointing – of recent years.  At Scottish level, the welcome doubling of active travel cash from 2018/19 onwards will start to be reflected on the ground in many towns and cities – but still in a transport context where the government’s top priority is ‘big transport,’ notably climate-damaging trunk road and air travel expansion. Continue reading Outlook for ? in 2019 – Edinburgh & ScotlandWe list the most popular Spokes tweets from the last 12 months, measured by the number of retweets (RTs).  They reflect a year in which there were no major threats to existing facilities or to existing major cycleroute proposals, but where no significant new cycleroute facilities appeared in the heart of the city either, although much future planning took place and of course there was the launch of Edinburgh’s long-awaited Bike Hire scheme. Continue reading Top Tweets 2018: a hiatus yearGrowing opportunities enabling more and more categories of people to get about by bike were a top feature of our ‘Diversity Rules’ public meeting … Continue reading #SpokesMtg … Diversity & OpportunityOur November 2018 traffic count, averaged over our 4 regular count points, found bikes forming 16.8% of all vehicles – the highest ever November percentage, up from last year’s 16.5%, and almost equalling the 16.9% in our summer (May) count.

Continue reading #SpokesComp: My Cycling TransformationLeith Street has reopened to traffic [1, 2] after its 10-month upgrade. But for all the hype about improvements, and there are indeed some welcome improvements, it remains basically the same – multiple lanes of mixed traffic, cyclists travelling uphill surrounded by lorries, cars and buses; and heavily-used footways which at the top are way below Council standards.

The beliefs behind Stone Carrying are at the core of ancient civilisations and indigenous cultures. The concept of the Keepership of the Stone has always been considered to be of great Sacred and Symbolic importance for the future well-being of all humanity on Earth.The circle of people imbue the Stone with their energy creating a form of record of the past and intention for the future.The Stone Carrier is specifically trained in Keepership from childhood and was believed born to offer his/her form for the benefit of the people through the Sacred carriage of the Stone - which symbolises the past story and hopes and dreams of the future for the community.The stones themselves call forward the future Dream of Life creating the contacts which will open the gateway to the future.Through Shamanic training in the Sacred ways of life, the Stone Keeper as the visionary and the Stone as the holder of the vision are simultaneously creating the way forward and making the necessary links which open the doors to our greatest potential for good.The African tradition of Stonecarrying originated in Great Zimbabwe. It consists of a group or community gathering in ceremony at the time of the full moon four times a year. The group identify concerns and issues within their community around a stone placed in the centre of a fire. Whilst the stone is in the fire the community around the fire hold ‘council’ each participating in the discussion of the best ways forward and options open to the community. The stone is then removed from the fire and each person holds the stone in an act of generating their energy and vision consciously to imbue the stone, thereby ‘feeding the stone’ with energy. The stone is then passed to the stonecarrier who literally takes the stone on a journey asking the stone to direct his/her footsteps and in believing thought and intention that the stone is taking the tribe forward and leading the way, by introducing the energy components needed for forward movement of the tribe. The African tradition differs from other types of Stonecarrying . The stone is believed to be a living energetic substance/body capable of incorporating thought and intention and passing the information absorbed between its’ form and association with the other energetic interactive form of the human as well as all other forms of energy whether they be animal vegetable or mineral.WesternWeb" 99749.0 0.0 "Caroline Keane, artist, is the Stonecarrier.

All photographs copyright Nick ShepherdWelcome to the official website of Strete in Devon, England, which is managed by Strete Parish Council. Strete is about a fifteen minute drive from Dartmouth. It is to be found on the high coastal ground at the eastern end of Slapton Sands. It's a good place to stay if you like exploring the local beaches and is also convenient for Kingsbridge, Totnes and Salcombe. Strete is situated on the South West Coastal Footpath and, with a variety of accommodation in the village, it is an ideal location to take a break in your journey. Take time to relax and enjoy the beautiful AONB surroundings.The latest South Hams second home statistics reveal that one in every 12 homes in the South Hams is a second home. The third highest in the UK.Recent data released by Government shows there are 3,835 second homes in the South Hams. This figure is more than seven times higher than the national average.South Hams District Council recognise there is a high proportion of second homes in the area and are supporting Neighbourhood Plans that limit second homes by introducing a principal residence policy that should result in restricted occupancy being applied on new developments .  Steering Group members of Strete Neighbourhood Plan have incorporated a Principal Residency Policy into the plan in response to comments from the community.A Neighbourhood Plan gives Strete community a much stronger voice in shaping the future of the village. Without it there is a risk that development may be introduced that does not consider the views of those who live and work in the parish. The plan will sit within the Plymouth and South West Devon Joint Local Plan currently being finalised.Once finalised and approved, both will have statutory force.Mark & Kat at The Kings Arms have arranged a menu and price for Strete Lunch 
Club.They have put together a 3 small course Strete Lunch Club menu in which they have included for everyone’s dietary preferences. The date planned is Thursday 15th November at 1:30 pm.Anyone interested should make contact at The Kings Arms to book a place and confirm their choice of meal.It 
will be nice to have the opportunity to welcome new people to the village and to get together with old friends whilst supporting Mark & Kat in their new venture.Now 
that Slapton Line has re-opened we can all look forward to contact with Slapton, 
Torcross, Chillington and Kingsbridge and getting back to normal.Let’s 
help Mark & Kat get The Kings Arms back to being a regular meeting place as 
well.Show more postsWould you like to make a comment about this website?Upcoming events in and around Strete.© Strete Parish Council | Designed by Kingsbridge Websites" 100114.0 0.0 "Strete, Devon"

Writing on the hard lineread my journalA history of missed and late payments makes it far more difficult to get a bad credit installment loan approved than it used to be. This is because customers who have previously defaulted are far more likely to do so again in the future. Lenders don’t just perform credit scoring in order to decline customers, they regularly do so because they use a tiered lending structure. Cheap bank loans are offered to those individuals who are considered a minimal risk. Although a low APR loan for poor credit is now unlikely, it is still possible to borrow money with bad credit at a higher rate of interest.Steps to Take Before a Bad Credit Installment Loan ApplicationPoor credit shows on a credit report for a period of not less than 7 years in America. In the case of chapter 7 bankruptcy, it shows for 10 years. That isn’t to say that a credit score remains constant throughout that timeframe because it doesn’t. There are a number of legal credit repair methods that can be used to rebuild credit ratings more quickly. Although accurately recorded adverse credit cannot be removed, there are things that can be done to improve a credit score. Prior to applying for a bank loan for bad credit, check for credit report errors and optimally redistribute revolving debt to get the best possible rating.Low Cost Family Loans for a Bad Credit HistoryIf in-between jobs or unable to offer the lender collateral, the most effective way to get the best loan rate is by borrowing money from a member of the family. The majority of close friends and family members will be prepared to offer an interest-free loan which makes it the perfect bad credit installment loan for those who are seeking to minimise repayments. The main problem is that default is likely to cause friction further down-the-line. If experiencing difficulty repaying a low cost loan, it is better to talk to that person rather than just hoping the situation will go away on its own.Door Step Lenders Offer Bad Credit History LoansIt may be possible to get unsecured poor credit loan from a doorstep lender, such as Provident Financial. They offer small bad credit installment loans for up to £500 to customers and then collect payment each month for a defined term. The rate of interest is typically in the region of 270% per annum. With rising default rates, the rate of interest is unlikely to change in the near future. Beware of dealing with other credit sharks as their recovery practices are not only unscrupulous, they are also highly illegal.Secured Bad Credit Installment Loans for HomeownersIn order to underwrite the risk of default, many lenders are still prepared to offer bank loans for bad credit that are secured against the properties equity. Home equity is defined as the difference between the value of a property and the mortgage loans, as well as any liens, that are secured against it. Customers can take out a standard low APR loan or second charge over a period of time that is as long as the mortgage itself. The main danger associated with a secured homeowner loan is that, failing to keep-up with the repayments, could lead to the repossession and sale of the family home.Low APR HELOC Loans for Bad Credit ScoresA HELOC loan works in the same way as a secured bad credit installment loan in the sense that the customer borrows money against the available equity. However, it is a low APR credit facility which means that interest is only paid on the money that is used. It is a source of revolving debt, like a secured credit card facility. Due to the risk of foreclosure, default rates amongst borrowers are extremely low. This allows adverse credit lenders to offer very competitively priced low APR loans to potential customers.Are Bad Credit Installment Loans Worthwhile?Few lenders, other than payday lenders, offer poor credit loans because default rates are extremely high. Even person-to-person lenders, such as Prosper.com, have been forced to stop proving them due to legal action by investors. Aside from borrowing money from a member of the family, the only way to get a low APR loan is through the provision of collateral. The problem is that failing to keep-up with the repayment terms will result in the repossession and sale of the property in order to recover the money. It is important to think carefully before securing a loan against property, especially if already struggling with debt.read my journalMassachusetts college students who have worked hard through high school and on their SATs and college essays just received another challenge: finding loan money. The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA), which has been providing student loans to Massachusetts residents for the past 26 years will not be lending any money to college students for the fall semester. This news comes well after college financial aid applications are due, and is leaving new and returning college students without private loans.
To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, last year, MEFA was the source of $510 million in loans to Massachusetts students attending college. MEFA provides private lending to Massachusetts residents attending colleges in-state and out-of-state.“At this time we regret that MEFA has been unable to secure funding due to increasingly difficult capital markets conditions,” Tom Graf, Executive Director of MEFA wrote in the announcement.Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA), a non-profit organization, had been offering Massachusetts college students and parents which were both low and fixed. According to MEFA, they will are still trying to secure funding for spring semester loans.What Massachusetts Students and Parents Can DoThis is a huge red flag that indicates our economy is continuing its downward spiral. The money these students were counting on was not free money or scholarship money. It was loans. Loans they have to pay back with interest. Now they can’t even do that. MEFA assures students that there is other money out there. But now that college students are about a month away from the beginning of school, and have their college bills in hand, where can they turn so late in the game?1. Call the MEFA HotlineMEFA has a toll-free number for Massachusetts college students and parents to call for information. The phone number is 800-809-0571.2. Seek a Federally-Funded LoanMEFA also recommends that students and/or their parents attempt to secure a federally-funded loan first.3. Contact the School’s Financial Aid OfficeThe school’s financial aid office should also be able to provide information to Massachusetts college students and parents who are left without loans.4. Ask for an ExtensionMassachusetts college students and parents who were relying on a MEFA loan should call the bursar or payment office at the college and request an extension on the bill or ask for a payment plan Massachusetts colleges should be aware of the situation.5. Contact American Student AssistanceThe Loan Information Center at American Student Assistance (ASA) may be reached by calling 800.999.9080. According to the ASA, Federal Family Education Loans are still available to college students.6. PLUS LoanParents of college students may also consider applying for a federal PLUS loan.read my journalIf you are a homeowner, there are many loan products that can work to your advantage; sometimes the most difficult part is picking the right product that fits your needs the best. Two loan products that are extremely popular are refinancing loans and home equity loans. Here is some information on both their similarities and differences.
Refinancing loans is usually the process of taking out a second loan in order to pay for the older loan, using the same property as collateral. The major advantage for refinancing your home is to benefit from a lower interest rate or better terms. Many homeowners purchase homes when they either had a lower credit score or when the market offered only higher interest rates. If your current credit score has improved or the banks and lenders are offering much lower interest rates, a refinancing loan may be a great way to lower your monthly payments, effectively reducing the amount to repay.A home equity loan is similar to a refinancing loan in that you use your home to secure the loan and if you fail to repay the loan, the bank can sell your home to recoup its losses. However, home equity loans are usually not for the entire value of the home, but only for the equity (equity is the current value of your home, less any debt). For most homeowners, the use of home equity loans is different than refinancing loans. Homeowners take out equity loans to make big ticket purchases such as additions to a home, tuition for college or to renovate a kitchen. While there are cash out options for refinancing loans, most refinancing loans are to save money and not to use the equity that has appreciated on their property.Home equity loans are usually a little less expensive, due to the fact that less money is being loaned. While fees such as closing costs and the appraisal are similar to a refinancing loan, there are usually no points involved. For refinancing loans a fee called points can be requested by the lender or bank. A point is usually equal to 1% of the loan amount and it is not uncommon to be charged by the lender 2, 3 or more points to refinance a loan.The great part about being a home owner is the many options that are available to you; however, it is always important to make sure you consider all your options to find the one that best fits your needs." 101466.0 0.0 "Symposium Journals – Writing on the hard line"

The Tatras were well received by owners of other marques at that first regional event and, from an initial fourteen members, the club grew steadily to its present count of around a hundred. Despite being UK based, we have members all over the world - as far away as Australia and the USA and throughout Europe. We are more of an 'English speaking' club than UK-focused, and welcome owners and non-owning enthusiasts alike.Home

Sit and relax, we’ll take careThe Goth Style is well known with its dark colors that express a strong and determined personality. You can easily recognize a Goth fan by the unique and mysterious outfit, but also by their interesting look. Devilish, yet sexy the Goth makeup is truly amazing and stylish. However, it is not something that should be overlooked. It may seem like taking candy from a baby but you have to remember that if you want to achieve that enigmatic look there are some simple rules you need to follow.1. Skin complexion
In order to get that pale look which is so typical for this style you need to work on your face… A lot. When you choose the foundation you have to be very careful. Go for a foundation that is a tone or two lighter than your skin tone. Take your time while spreading the foundation. Make sure that you even it out all over the face. Do not forget the neck.2. The eyes
Well, this is the part where you need to be diligent. Your eyes are supposed to be dramatic for this look, but you must know your boundaries – especially when it comes to a day makeup. Every Goth, both male and female cannot go without a black eyeliner – it is essential and it highlights the eyes a lot against the pale skin complexion. By using either a liquid eyeliner or a dark eye pencil shape the form of your eyes the way you want to. The dark eye shadows are perfect in this case and you do not have to use only the black. Every dark color like deep blue, burgundy or purple would be a great choice. Just try to match it with your outfit or at least with a part of it. Do not miss the lower eyelids. Finally, the mascara! Make sure that you apply another coat of mascara after the first one is dried out.3. The blush
Never use too much product while highlighting your cheekbones. It will destroy the whole idea of the pale face. You need to look for blush in the beige color scheme.4. About these gorgeous lips
Your everyday Goth look will not be complete without some color on your lips. Just like for the eyes – you can use purple, black or burgundy to make them look big and juicy. Also, get a lip liner that matches the color of the lipstick and carefully outline your lips.By following these basic steps you will definitely stand out and make an impression. Just remember that the whole concept of this amazing and eerie style hides in the details. And your perfect Goth makeup is one of them.Planning a purchase?

The Pier 
          House is central to the tiny village of Inverie on the shore of 
          Loch Nevis. You can't drive here, but Pier House is only one hundred 
          yards from a regular ferry service - the Western Isles - which leaves 
          for Mallaig for Inverie at least three days per week throughout the 
          year. Mallaig is the final stop on the scenic 'Road to the Isles' and 
          the terminus of the West Highland Railway with its steam trains. Mallaig 
          is one starting point for a visit to the Rough Bounds of Knoydart - 
          sometimes called 'the last wilderness'. Or you could 'walk in' to Inverie 
          along the old drovers' paths ? or even sail into Loch Nevis and

Dominating the farmyard was a large Granary built of wood under a tiled roof standing raised up on large saddle stones, which were eventually used in the construction of the present-day cottages.We were married in Avebury.

Stylish, discreet, creative and thoughtful, are words that are used to describe my approach to wedding photography.Keeping things simple and relaxed, I capture real events of your wedding as they happen during the day, together with a loosely directed shoot of the two of you and a handful of formal family group shots.The result… A collection of beautiful, vivid photographs that tell the story with timeless style.Over the past fifteen years I’ve worked as a full time professional wedding photographer in London and Kent. Having photographed over 400 weddings worldwide, I’ve developed a distinct, but timeless style which is both modern and classic.I consistently create exceptional photographs, with a calm and unobtrusive approach. Keeping things simple, I capture events as they happen throughout the day, using a reportage / documentary method of observational photography, along with loosely directed images and formal family photography where required.I not only love working with natural light, but also the challenge of low light and the subtle colours that it creates. I draw inspiration from all corners, including photojournalism, architecture, renaissance art and visual aspects of past eras such as art deco design, old movies and vintage fashion.Finding my place among the best wedding photographers London has to offer, I have photographed weddings in many iconic venues such as St Paul’s Cathedral (OBE Chapel), Drapers Hall, Merchant Taylors Hall, Greenwich Naval College, Eltham Palace, Westminster (Maylebone) Town Hall, Islington Town Hall, Chelsea Town Hall, The Mayfair Library, The Dorchester Hotel, The Barclay Hotel, The Mayfair Hotel and many more.Although I often work in London, I am now based in Kent. I consider myself to be an international wedding photographer covering weddings abroad, as well as throughout the UK, having worked at Blenheim Palace, Highclere Castle, Leez Priory, Pembroke Lodge, Preston Court, Hampton Court House and dozens of other amazing venues across the country and around the world.With the rich diversity that London has to offer, I’ve photographed many types of weddings over the years, with experience in civil ceremonies, gay weddings, Jewish weddings, Greek Orthodox weddings, Chinese weddings, Hindu ceremonies, Humanist ceremonies to name just a few.I use professional photographic equipment, combining a Nikon D4 digital camera with a range of fast prime and zoom Nikkor lenses (I also carry a full range of back-up equipment).I’ve had my work published in many newspapers and wedding magazines, including The Sunday Times, Cosmopolitan Bride Magazine, You & Your Wedding Magazine, Hello! Mayfair Resident Magazine, Your London Wedding Magazine, The Westminster Wedding Guide and many more.Although I shoot a good number of weddings every year, a large section of my business is in commercial photography. Shooting food & drink, interiors, product and lifestyle, I’ve worked with many clients producing high quality images for marketing, advertising through print and web based projects.

Building construction is one of the most exciting commercial 
              activities in the land. It is fast moving, full of change, full of 
              personalities and characters. The focal point is the customer and 
              what he wants from his building. That’s why things get changed 
              during the construction works. If the customer changes his mind, 
              let him have what he wants. Managing that change invariably means 
              managing cost and time; managing too the differences of opinion 
              which inevitably flow from a changed plan of campaign. 
              Professional teams will reach different conclusions about impact 
              on time and cost and require independent decision making to avoid 
              differences undermining the team relationships on site.This Web site helps explain the variety of management 
              techniques, which the modern manager can turn to for effective 
              machinery to dispose of differences of opinion. For example it is 
              no longer necessary (or even right) to rush into
              litigation. There are several far 
              more effective ways of controlling a dispute. Construction in the 
              UK for example will invariably opt for a super fast 28-day dispute 
              management system called Adjudication. 
              It has now found favour in the International Standard Form 
              Contract documents. Mediation is world wide too. It is remarkable 
              for its effect, especially in preserving relationships. Look too 
              at the modern arbitrator. The 
              emphasis now is on efficient and economic but thorough forensic 
              inquiry. As to litigation, the English lawyers on 26 April 1999 
              completely altered its procedural rules to fundamentally improve 
              civil litigation, and its working.On the left of this page is a row of yellow buttons. They will 
              take you to additional information on ‘dispute management’. At
              “The Column” button you will find 
              the weekly page in ‘Building’ magazine, which I have written since 
              1987. The ‘Links’ button takes you to

Our dedicated customer service team are on hand to answer any questions related to installation of our products.  Our technical trained team can offer additional support and advice on a wide range of subjects. We can also provide an installation guide if required.In the interests of performance and safety we recommend that all installation work is carried out to applicable codes of practice.Due to the many beneficial properties of cast iron rainwater and soil goods, minimal maintenance is required for Tuscan castings.  We recommend an annual inspection of cast iron rainwater, soil or drainage systems and clearance of any debris and or blockages. Painted surfaces should be cleared of any contamination and any deterioration of paint should be touched up.We work to ensure that our business activities comply with, and where possible surpass, applicable environmental standards and legislation.  We aim to implement processes and practices which help to minimise risk and protect the environment and eco systems from environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes.  We will reduce to a minimum the environmental impacts of our production activities and develop a pro-active approach when taking in to account our local community.We aim to do business with only those suppliers who share our core values and approach to corporate social responsibility. We aim to purchase from only those suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to improving or maintaining acceptable standards on labour, health and safety and environmental practices.Our cast iron rainwater products are manufactured in accordance with BS460.The EN877 Halifax Soil System has been awarded British Board of AgrÃ©ment (BBA) third party accreditation certificate number 06/4401. The scope of the accreditation is detailed within the certificate. The EN877 Halifax System bears the CE markings as required to conform to the Construction Products Regulations (CPR).No other material offers the aesthetic appeal of cast iron, one which can satisfy all the requirements of traditional architecture.  It is the logical choice for listed properties, conservation areas and heritage work.We understand that not all buildings suit the standard range of products and that many buildings have cast iron gutter, pipes and hoppers that are unique to that individual structure.Specialist patterns and castings can be produced at the foundry located in Halifax, West Yorkshire. We have the experience and capability to manufacture bespoke casting and fabricated products to support our comprehensive standard range of cast iron rainwater and soil goods.The Halifax site comprises of the pattern making shop, foundry and fabrication facilities, which enables us to manufacture bespoke items to meet your requirements. Our customer service team will manage your order throughout each stage of the process; ensuring the most cost effective production options are selected and quality standards and delivery deadlines are met in full.Many bespoke commissions start with a client who is trying to reproduce a casting in the style or shape of a pattern which is no longer available. Our in house technical team will be able to work with either a sample from site to replicate an existing casting or a detailed drawing to create a product to a completely new design.Renovation or extension of a period property can require, for example, radius gutters to match the specific curvature of the building and design of gutter or ornamental hopper heads to match existing installations like for like. In most cases drawings are not available, our technical support will work closely with the client at any stage of the project until we have a new casting which is compliant with current building regulations and listed building consent where applicable.Standard products can also be altered to provide a specialist solution for your project. For example, fixing ears can be added to rainwater and soil fittings; pipe and gutter fittings can be made to specific angles and projection dimensions; and castings can be customised with dates or embellishments.We can also produce bespoke cast iron radius gutters that are as unique as your project.Tuscan Premier rainwater systems are available in a choice of 3 different exterior coatings, Premier grey primed, Premier Extra black gloss or Premier Extra coloured.Most Premier standard rainwater products are now available in Premier Extra black gloss finish from stock. Tuscan painted cast iron rainwater and soil goods are produced with an industry leading finish.Premier Extra coloured offers any cast iron rainwater items supplied pre-painted to match any RAL or BS colour reference. We are also able to offer a Colour Match service taken from an existing sample. When considering a coloured finish to your product, we recommend you consult your our team for advice about the choice and suitability of choice colours.Premier Extra pre-painted systems provide the following additional benefitsImportant note:
            Life expectancy for the coating does not apply to locations within a three kilometres distance of marine or coastal environments. In these circumstances please consult our team for advice on a suitable coating choice." 107168.0 0.0 "

If you’ve been declined for credit, it can be difficult to know what to do. Missed payments during the last 7-years will have been reported to credit reference agencies so borrowing money will be far more difficult. This is because financial institutions use a process known as credit scoring to ascertain your creditworthiness as a new customer. You’re considered too high a credit risk to do business with.If you’re looking for cash loans for people on low income, possibly due to unemployment and state benefits, you’ll need to turn to a specialist bad credit lender. Rather than following the eligibility criteria that the banks use, they use a different list of determinants. Lenders offer bad credit low income loans with no credit checks based on whether they’re affordable or not. Past indiscretions won’t get in the way of acceptance.No Credit Check Loans for People on Low Income from a PawnbrokerIf you’ve for collateral, such as silver or gold, you can get a cash advance from a pawn shop. Just take in your item of value and ask them how much they’re prepared to lend you, the rate of interest and the repayment term. Most pawnbrokers offer loans for low income families for 30-days, but will lend money for up to 6-months. It’s really just a matter of shopping about for the deal that is most suitable for you.You’ll be handed your cash over the counter along with a receipt in order that you can redeem your collateral. The pawnbroker will hold onto the item until your bad credit low income loan is repaid. If you aren’t in a position to repay the balance, you can settle the interest and ask if they’re prepared to extend to the term. If you fail to clear the debt, the collateral you’ve provided will be sold to pay off the balance.Very Bad Credit Payday Loans for Low Income FamiliesIf you don’t have any collateral, the only way that you can get loans for people on low income is from an unsecured bad credit lender. Payday companies offer poor credit cash advances of up to $500 to customers who are unemployed and on state benefits. If you have a full-time job, you’ll be able to borrow up to $1000. You’ll also need to be a US citizen, over-18 and have a personal checking account.Payment won’t be made to you in cash due to the risk of fraud. Instead, the money will be sent to you by same day bank transfer and will arrive within 24-hours. The quick cash advance isn’t secured so there aren’t any immediate implications that come from default. However, your account will be passed to a collection agency. Interest and charges accrue quickly so only borrow money if you can afford to repay it.Pros and Cons of Guaranteed Small Cash Loans for Low Income EarnersIf you’re finding it difficult to pay the rent due to a cash shortfall that month, cash loans for people on low income or state benefits can help you out of a financial hole. You’ll typically receive your money within 24-hours. If you borrow money from a pawnbrokers, you’ll receive payment within just minutes. If you’re getting a cash advance with bad credit from a payday lender, apply before noon for same day payment.The problem with borrowing money on a low income is that you’ll need to repay it and may lack the means to do so. If you’re struggling to pay your bills this month, will loans for people on low income really help you? You’ll not only need to repay the principal, but you’ll have to clear any interest that has accrued as well. The danger is that you’ll become trapped in a cycle of dependency which brings even greater financial hardship." 107507.0 0.0 "UFH Hypnotics – Look into my eyes"

Polarity Therapy is a popular form of treatment which is increasingly sought after, as people look to complementary and more holistic approaches to ill health; alongside more conventional methods through their GP.This amazing approach to health and healing - originally developed by Dr Randolph Stone, DO, DC, ND - employs a profound system that blends both Eastern and Western concepts of health.A Practitioner / Therapist always deals with the whole person - mentally, emotionally and physically - and gently assists your body to heal itself naturally.Polarity Therapy is truly a complementary science. It recognises that energy has to move from a positive to a negative pole, through a neutral field - a concept which was applied by Dr Stone to the human constitution.Science and Theory. This scientific 'law' is fundamental to the movement of energy throughout the Universe and the Earth around us: it manifests in our physical body as energetic currents, which Dr Stone referred to as the ‘Wireless Anatomy of Man'.This amazing modality addresses many different levels: subtle energy; nervous, musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular, myofascial, respiratory and digestive systems; as well as the emotional and mental levels. It tackles many varied and different expressions of disease by unlocking the holding patterns that create the symptoms. Dr. Stone called it Polarity because it embodies the negative and positive poles and the neutrality between them. This Modality is a healing art, an anchor for a balanced lifestyle, an evolving way of being, an adjunct to other modalities.Session / Treatment.Practitioners.Newsletter /BlogTrainingPolarity Books.Polarity InformationMembership Application Form for UKPTARPP / EPP / StudentClick for pdf fileUK Polarity TherapyAssociationCopyright © All rights reserved.

The waitress was fantastic, she was very professional, friendly and chatty, even making a smaller sundae for our mum, which was delicious.We stayed here on 29th September for one night in room no 1... it was absolutely fantastic, the room was clean with a lovely view. Had a good night sleep in the super king size bed.Friendly and welcoming staff and an excellent lunch in the cosy and atmospheric bar. We stayed here several years several years ago and decided to call in for lunch on our way home. Food was excellent and great value. Fabulously fresh crab and prawn sandwiches and soup.Thank you for the recommendation to make the trip to the Ulbster Arms. It was worth the 16 mile trip from our hotel for dinner.

This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at
                /var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
                fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc
                package was installed on this server.The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to
                any file apart of those located in /var/www,
                public_html
                directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.The default Debian document root is /var/www/html. You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.Please use the reportbug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Debian. However, check existing
                bug reports before reporting a new bug.Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself." 109394.0 0.0 "Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works"

Welcome to Wire Magic - A Guide to Wire Crafts. Within these pages you'll find simple wirework projects, information about pliers and cutters, a gallery of work by artists from around the world, a listing of wire and tool suppliers and introductions to books about wire work including Michael Ball's Wire Magic.Gallery
Check out the  wirework artists from around the world.Wirework is becoming increasingly popular - a glance around almost any interiors shop will often reveal dozens of items made from wire, and many craft shops now stock wire of all types and descriptions.It would be easy to assume that this is a recent trend, but the origins of the craft can be traced back over four hundred years to central Europe, where generations of tinkers made a living repairing items with wire. This small scale craft developed until at its height tens of thousands of people were employed as wireworkers across America and Europe making everything from fruit bowls and lampshades to chandeliers and elaborate pieces of furniture.Today there are dozens of different kinds of wire available in all sorts of surface finishes and colors, but some things haven't changed. Wirework is still a craft that relies on simple hand tools rather than expensive equipment, and many of the skills and techniques of modern wireworkers are identical to those used by travelling tinkers for centuries.For more information about the history of wirework, take a look at the Tinkers of Slovakia.August 2, 2005" 112471.0 0.0 "Wire Magic - A Guide to Wire Crafts"

Then we will head off into the thousands of acres of surrounding countryside for approximately 5 hours riding on a variety of terrain including hills, river crossings, forest tracks and lots of mud!ABOUT USIt's a fun day out on an off-road motorbike with some basic tuition, aimed at motorcycle riders who are looking to try out off-roading. These courses are designed for people with limited or no previous off-road motorcycle experience, although can still be an enjoyable day out for more experienced dirt bike riders where the emphasis is more on fun than serious training. You will get to ride on the thousands of acres of beautiful countryside on a wide variety of terrain from farmland, forest tracks and technical single track and amaze yourselves what you and the bikes are capable of!After getting kitted up and briefed by our Instructors, we will then take a short ride out to our gravel based training area. We will spend some time going through the basics of riding an adventure trail bike on off road terrain, including correct positioning on the bike, sitting, standing, braking, cornering and up & down hills. We will then pick up some easy trails, giving you the opportunity to put your new found skills into practice, whilst heading in the direction of a country pub for a much needed lunch stop.Our Enduro training schools are aimed at regular trail riders through to National level competition riders. The emphasis of these schools is to help improve and learn new riding skills. All aspects of enduro riding are covered from bike maintenance and preparation, riding ruts, uphills, downhills, special tests, extreme man made sections and Welsh bogs. Groups are split up into similar ability riders and go away with 2 instructors to cover various aspects, and change between instructors throughout the weekend. We have our usual team of instructors as well as some top British and World level riders as guest instructors.Our 1-2-1 Enduro coaching allows us to give you 100% of our attention, allowing us to tailor the session to your specific ability, needs and requirements. It ensures you get as much for the session as possible, and offers the biggest steps forward whether you are a recreational trial rider wanting to develop the skills to make the day easier or give you the skills and confidence to tackle more difficult trails, or you are competitive enduro rider looking to step it up to the next level. We can tailor the session to you, no matter whether you are just starting out in Enduro’s or are a top level British Championship rider.We also specialise in tailor made courses for Police Forces, the Services, Motorcycle Clubs, Schools and other groups wishing to undertake professional off road training. These courses can be designed to suit your individual requirements and you can either use your own machinery or our Yamaha off road bikes (Hyperlink to bikes page). We can run these at our base in Mid Wales or at your own off road venue. Please contact us for details.There are at least two instructors out on a day, who are there to guide and advise you whenever you need it.  There is a high instructor/rider ratio which ensures that you really get the most enjoyment out of your day. Throughout the day riders may be split into groups of similar ability to ensure that everybody gets the most out of their day.There are permanent changing rooms, toilets and showers all on site.We welcome people who want to come along to one of our courses with their own motorcycle providing that it is suitable for the course, in good working order and adequately silenced.The 2017 season was a great one for the team with Jamie Lewis winning the European E2 Enduro Championship aboard the WR 450F and Lee Sealey winning the British E1 title on the WR 250F.  Jamie has decided after many years of racing top level motocross and enduro, to take a break from full time racing.  He will still be involved with the team, racing selected events and mentoring some of the younger riders.  Lee has decided that he wants to race motocross for 2018.  He will stay racing for Yamaha with the Sevenseven2 team in the AMCA MX 2 Championship.  We would like to wish Lee all the best for the 2018 season.The 2017 season was a great one for the team with Jamie Lewis winning the European E2 Enduro Championship aboard the WR 450F and Lee Sealey winning the British E1 title on the WR 250F.  Jamie has decided after many years of racing top level motocross and enduro, to take a break from full time racing.  He will still be involved with the team, racing selected events and mentoring some of the younger riders.  Lee has decided that he wants to race motocross for 2018.  He will stay racing for Yamaha with the Sevenseven2 team in the AMCA MX 2 Championship.  We would like to wish Lee all the best for the 2018 season.The 2018 season has been another successful year for the team, with Fraser Flockhart winning the Scottish  Enduro Championship and Charlie Evans the Welsh Enduro Championship.Our gift vouchers make the ideal Christmas present for friends and family.

International UK Wedding Photographers + VideographersSTAY IN THE MOMENTCandid photography with personalityYork Place Studios are Dom, Liam, Alex and Matt: a multi-award winning family collective of street-documentary style international UK wedding photographers and videographers who seek to find big stories in even the smallest of moments throughout every single stage of a wedding day.Our focus is on people and personality, seeking to create lasting memories with connection, humour, life and atmosphere, just the way it felt to be there.Real stories, real personality, real memories. Real moments that really matter.REQUEST A QUOTEYou’ll often hear us described as either Reportage or Documentary Wedding Photographers and Videographers. In fact we’ve even been credited as the creators of a whole new alternative genre known as Street Documentary Wedding Photography. Whilst those terms are certainly fitting to the natural, unposed, un-intrusive way we approach our wedding photography and filming (and you can read more about that approach here), in truth neither of those descriptions are really what we’re about. At the heart of it our style is incredibly simple: It’s about you.Turn up the volume and watch this sixty second slideshow below to see more of the moments we love to capture.You and your personalities are at the centre of everything we do. We capture every image right there in the moment: carefully composed but completely un-staged. We never look to recreate past photos or retrace our steps from another wedding, we find new, authentic imagery inspired by the people around us. Your wedding memories aren’t just about traditional set pieces and your photographs can be so much more powerful than that. They should celebrate the relationships between your family and friends. They should showcase the spontaneous, unpredictable, beautiful, hilarious, sometimes ridiculous stories that we find around you. Your photographs should be like printouts of your memories. We want to take you right back to the moment they were taken and help you experience once again how it felt to be there.Meaningful memories can never be forced or forged, they come from real moments, from people being themselves. Whether big moments or small, these are the moments that matter.We’re a family team at York Place: husband, wife and two brothers. Family is important to us and perhaps that’s why we view family and friends as the most important part of your wedding. This is the one time that everyone you know from every stage and adventure of your life comes together. Different people, different personalities all bound by one common denominator: their affection for you.Your wedding is an opportunity to really celebrate with those people. A chance to have fun, party like never before and live and love every last second of it. Weddings are a love story but they’re also a story of friendship and of laughter. That’s what we believe your photos and films should be about too!As International UK Wedding Photographers and videographers as well as Street Photographers and Educators we’re lucky enough to travel across the globe. We’ve travelled as far and wide as Cuba, Tokyo, Sri Lanka, the United States and across the length and breadth of Europe from Poland to France. Wherever we go though it’s people, not places that are at the centre of our world. Our style of photography is discreet, unstaged and playful. Our mission is to create powerful, unique wedding photography without posing throughout every part of your day. So from a simple pub wedding to the most epic destination wedding location, from 20 guests to 1000; every wedding is completely unique and an absolute honour to be a part of.CHECK OUR AVAILABILITYMAKING SMALL MOMENTS BIG SINCE 2006." 113948.0 0.0 "UK Wedding Photographers and Videographers | York Place Studios"
